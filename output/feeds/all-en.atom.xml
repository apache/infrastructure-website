&lt;h2&gt;Infra Reporting Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard, at &lt;a href="https://infra-reports.apache.org/" target="_blank"&gt;infra-reports.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;, provides a collection of reports on the overall health and activity of the infrastructure at the ASF.

&lt;h2&gt;Infra Reporting Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard, at &lt;a href="https://infra-reports.apache.org/" target="_blank"&gt;infra-reports.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;, provides a collection of reports on the overall health and activity of the infrastructure at the ASF. These reports can be helpful in understanding the status of all the ASF 'under the hood' resources, and in assessing the resource cost of some activities, like build processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the reports are open to the public, while others are restricted to those who genuinely need them; see the documentation at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/infra-reports.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/infra-reports.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MFA at the ASF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is working on policies to cover use of multi-factor authorization (MFA) at The ASF, and tooling to support and enable those policies. The goal is to provide the best-possible security for user accounts at the lowest reasonable level of disruption to work processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft of the main MFA policy, with a link to the policy on restoring MFA when someone has lost a key element of it, is available at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/mfa.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/mfa.html&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we refine the policy and bring the tools to support it online, we will update the policy page. We will make a general announcement when we are close to bringing MFA live for The ASF and its projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no April roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May Roundtable will be on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, 1700 UTC. The topic of the day will be "How PMCs can use the STeVe voting tool", with a live demonstration. There will probably also be time for unstructured discussion about other issues and concerns related to infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Info about the roundtables is at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/roundtable.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Access to the Confluence Wiki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with the creation of spammy accounts and risks to ASF and project information on the wiki, we have limited account-creation: committers and ASF members can automatically log in to the ASF Confluence Wiki without creating an account. At the moment people who do not have an ASF LDAP account &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; create an account in the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue of &lt;em&gt;Inside Infra&lt;/em&gt; will appear near the end of May, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Inside Infra March 2024</title><link href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/inside-infra-march-2024.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:infra.apache.org,2024-03-23:/blog/inside-infra-march-2024.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong&gt;Inside Infra&lt;/strong&gt; for March, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Policy change on use of GitHub Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to misconfigurations in their builds, some projects have been using unsupportable numbers of GitHub Actions. As part of fixing this situation, Infra has added a 'resource use' section to the policy on GitHub Actions. This section of the policy will come into effect on &lt;strong&gt;April 20, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workflows MUST have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 20. This means a workflow cannot have more than 20 jobs running at the same time across all matrices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workflows SHOULD have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 15. Just because 20 is the max, doesn't mean you should strive for 20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average number of minutes a project uses per calendar week MUST NOT exceed the equivalent of 25 full-time runners (250,000 minutes, or 4,200 hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average number of minutes a project uses in any consecutive five-day period MUST NOT exceed the equivalent of 30 full-time runners (216,000 minutes, or 3,600 hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects whose builds consistently cross the maximum use limits will lose their access to GitHub Actions until they fix their build configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full policy is at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html" target="_blank"&gt;https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Roundtable of March 3, 2024, Clay Johnson of Gradle outlined the testing features that come with Develocity, focussing on their use with Gradle and Maven. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build scan gives insights into what goes on in a build, and can help a project quickly focus on tests that are failing or flaky, and address related code issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictive test selection can speed up certain types of builds by skipping the tests that are not relevant to the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fuller summary of this discussion, and conversation about GitHub Runners and other topics, is at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-03-06%2C+17%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-03-06%2C+17%3A00+UTC&lt;/a&gt;, and is available to ASF Members and Committers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: There will be &lt;strong&gt;no April 2024 Roundtable&lt;/strong&gt;. The series will resume in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The end of Apache Paste Bucket?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Infra rolled out Apache Paste Bucket (&lt;code&gt;http://paste.apache.org/&lt;/code&gt;). In a blog entry at the time, we described it as an "ASF-driven site for posting snippets, scripts, logging output, configurations and much more and sharing them with the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool has seen some use over the past decade, but has had very little traffic in the last couple of years. To keep Apache Paste Bucket available, the code would require a significant upgrade. Unless we hear that the tool is important to some part of the ASF community, we plan to shut down Apache Paste in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next newsletter will appear toward the end of April, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Inside Infra February 2024</title><link href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/inside-infra-february-2024.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:infra.apache.org,2024-02-20:/blog/inside-infra-february-2024.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, all!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Newsletter name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our very unscientific poll showed that "Inside Infra" has the most support as a name for this newsletter, so that is what we shall be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: in 2020 the main ASF blog published a series of interviews with Infra team members also called "Inside Infra". Links …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, all!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Newsletter name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our very unscientific poll showed that "Inside Infra" has the most support as a name for this newsletter, so that is what we shall be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: in 2020 the main ASF blog published a series of interviews with Infra team members also called "Inside Infra". Links to the interviews are available at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/The+Infrastructure+team" target="_blank"&gt;The Infrastructure team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2023 year-end survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held our second annual year-end survey and got a lot of participation. Overall satisfaction with Infra's work seems high, but there were also a series of very useful suggestions and ideas. This newsletter, in fact, is a response to one of the suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey summary is on our &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/2023%20Infra%20Survey%20Results.html" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The February Roundtable focused on Keycloak and related security issues but, as is often the case, conversation also moved usefully into several other areas and concerns, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is concern that it is difficult to find a link to Infra's website, or even know that it exists, from the main ASF website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A suggestion to develop project-level security groups for GitHub Issues, based on roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be a CalDev service that would support an events calendar for each project that wants one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was discussion of trying to find a forum solution that could in time replace the requirement for email-based conversation threads for project decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The summary of the conversation is on the Infra Confluence wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Infra Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;March 6, 2024 1700 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;. The main topic, before the suggestions start to fly, will be &lt;strong&gt;improving automated testing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note: Develocity is hoping to roll out predictive test / flaky test analysis, to help projects improve their test suites so they generate more reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on how the roundtables work, and how to join in, is at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/roundtable.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;.asf.yaml info available&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.asf.yaml is an important tool in managing project websites and other services. It is a branch-specific configuration file that a project may create and put in the root of a Git repository to control features such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notification schemes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;website staging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelican builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for .asf.yaml  was on the Infra Cwiki, but is now is in its repository's README file: &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfyaml/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank"&gt;github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfyaml/blob/main/README.md&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-serve and wiki accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An addition to the Apache self-serve tool will let a user request a Cwiki account. The request goes for approval to the project the user specifies. The project can also grant the user write access, should that be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is not yet available, but is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delivery issues with Gmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are subscribed to an ASF mailing list with a Gmail account, you may experience missing list mail. This is due to changes Google made that cause rejection of ASF mailing list mail to Gmail addresses. Infra is currently investigating this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or your project experience this, Infra has a workaround which we can apply to your mailing list, but some messages may
still be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excellent questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best stuff Infra does has evolved from project members' questions and suggestions. If you have an infrastructure-related question, feel free to ask it on the &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; email list. We may share your question, and our answer to it, in a coming newslette&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a summary of the responses to questions and the comments added in each section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're grateful to those who took the time to fill out the survey. Without feedback like this, the Infra team can feel a bit like it is flailing around in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary of responses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infra Roundtables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;82% of survey respondents have attended an Infra Roundtable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reasons for not having attended include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time constraints (most frequent response)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was not aware it existed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not need it / no pressing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timezone issues (the roundtables frequently happen at a time which is more convenient to people in Europe and North American than in Asia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;88.9% say the roundtables ‘provide value’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics respondents would like roundtables to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things Infra is working on that might be useful to PMCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerability scanning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation of&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;voting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;policy compliance verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to make it easier for contributors to projects to contribute to Infra coding tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic hackathons Infra hackathons open to all contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series of FAQs / tutorials on common tasks at the ASF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;81% agreed that Infra is getting better at open communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further communications improvement suggestions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic newsletter (implemented!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email announcements of important matters to all members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better connection of each Infra service with its documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News box on the landing page at &lt;code&gt;infra.a.o&lt;/code&gt; needs to be updated more frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions to &lt;code&gt;users@infra.a.o&lt;/code&gt; seem to go unanswered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be more consistent in showing latest and earlier versions of info on the wiki pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public archive containing summaries of all main points in all roundtables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic publication of the basic stuff, such as 'Where is self-serve?'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95% feel Infra offers adequate technical services for their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service improvement suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactively improve the security posture of all ASF projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating releases (this is coming!) and dependency upgrades for CVE mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free BSD runners and CI builder on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More docs and examples for VM setup via puppet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password management solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More powerful GitHub Action runners for all platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video call service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked which existing services need improvement. These areas got the most votes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD (Jenkins, BuildBot, GitHub Actions – 62%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue Tracking (Jira, GitHubIssues, Bugzilla) – 31%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation / Wiki pages – 31%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source control (GitHub/GitBox, SVN) – 19%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging (Slack, mailing lists) – 19%  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archived blog content is greatly bit rotted with no way to fix; no good modern blogging options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASF project websites vary widely in visual appeal and functionality. How to make it easier to quickly set up ‘modern looking’ websites?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue tracking – automated scripts to migrate existing issues from Jira to GitHub Issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix tool sprawl – self-serve, whimsy, reporter, cveprocess...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins seems outdated. Would prefer something like Concourse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research an official Stack Overflow integration as an alternative to users’ lists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In CI/CD, we don’t really have any CD. Where can we deploy test apps?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control over Docker Hub repos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds are sometimes flaky because of disk-full error, broken hardware, missing build tools...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds are very slow for projects with a large number of modules and different workflows for different test suites. Such projects need more dedicated resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s easy for projects to configure build pipelines that don’t work well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I shouldn’t have to create a filter to understand the context of an email from the ASF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struggling to find good documentation on Buildbot hosts, in particular for setting up a Windows build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a multilanguage project, Kotlin is not counted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mailing list noise from GitHub/GitBox. Drop messages from some bots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a simple build caching solution for Jenkins so we can cache Maven repositories between builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a good template for the static part of project websites. (Working on it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no documentation on cleanup after a build and main + subpath deployment of a website, nor an example to start with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long build queues on ASF Jenkins; problems with GHA builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins builds should be containerized and isolated from one another, so one build does not bring down a node for everybody else. Need guaranteed minimum performance for performance-sensitive build tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the messaging of Jira to the mailing lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Year’s resolutions for projects:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope to make more frequent releases (multiple mentions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get it fully, reproducibly built with OID integration to release it via Trusted Publishing to PyPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce ‘onboarding barriers’ and bridging projects for more synergy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add documentation tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attracting more people to work on the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Year’s hopes to get from Infra, the ASF, from your project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use and secure package and releasing platform (Working on it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An arrangement with medium or substack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD/BSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More stability for Ubuntu Jenkins nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automated voting tool (Working on it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI stabiity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More powerful GitHub Runners for all platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feedback for the Infra team:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the comments were positive, with thanks for our efforts and good wishes for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was one “Well, there is that one guy...” (working on it!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>The Infra Newsletter January 2024</title><link href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/the-infra-newsletter-january-2024.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:infra.apache.org,2024-01-20:/blog/the-infra-newsletter-january-2024.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who responded to our annual survey (see below) suggested that we start a newsletter to share developments and other news. The suggester thought we should send it to the &lt;code&gt;dev@&lt;/code&gt; list of every PMC and PPMC, but we are going to start with a more limited distribution and see if the benefit to readers outweighs the additional email traffic. If you would like to get each issue in your email inbox, make sure you are subscribed to &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete text of each month's newsletter appears here on the Infra blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect to see a new installment of the newsletter toward the end of each month. If you have suggestions, please share them in an email to &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Infra year-end survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we start 2024, we're using a survey to review infrastructure developments and plans for the ASF. We will compile responses into an anonymized report to share with the whole ASF community and to provide the Infrastructure team with insights that may help us improve our work in the new year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not had a chance to fill out the survey yet, &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/rQwYykCuP3Z1ij5Z9" target="_blank"&gt;it is here&lt;/a&gt;. It will be active until &lt;strong&gt;February 2, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Infra Roundtable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year the Infrastructure team started holding monthly &lt;strong&gt;Roundtable&lt;/strong&gt; meetings, in response to requests for a way to discuss infrastructure issues and initiatives. In 2023, we held ten such meetings, usually on the first Wednesday of each month. One meeting was face-to-face, as a part of Community Over Code North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an Infra member generally makes a brief presentation on some topic, this is not the sort of gathering where we talk and talk and you meekly listen. We enjoy hearing insights from all across the ASF universe, and some very good ideas have emerged from Roundtable meetings and become part of Infra's work plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtables last an hour and take place in a huddle in the Infra channel in the Apache space on Slack. Instructions on how to join the roundtables are at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/roundtable.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to summaries of all meetings are at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable" target="_blank"&gt;cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, February 7, 2024 1700 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, and we will focus on &lt;a href="https://www.keycloak.org" target="_blank"&gt;Keycloak&lt;/a&gt; and two factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infra and conferences in 2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Infra will be taking part in both &lt;strong&gt;Community over Code&lt;/strong&gt; (CoC) &lt;strong&gt;Europe&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CoC North America&lt;/strong&gt; in 2024, we will not be able to send team members to &lt;strong&gt;CoC Asia&lt;/strong&gt;. It would be great if anyone attending could pass on to us, by email or through our Slack channel, insights or issues discussed at the conference that are relevant to Infra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in a name?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we call this thing? "The Infra Newsletter" is straightforward, but maybe not all that catchy. "Infractions", while being a cute mashup of "Infra" and "actions", may not be clear to readers for whom English is not their best language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/TCEDGdE9VHM45CGJA" target="_blank"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to vote for a name you prefer for the Infra newsletter: The poll is on Google Drive, but you do not have to log in to use it. The poll will stay open until &lt;strong&gt;February 5, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Add your wisdom to Infra</title><link href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/add-your-wisdom-to-infra.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-17T01:55:55+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-17T01:55:55+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:infra.apache.org,2023-11-17:/blog/add-your-wisdom-to-infra.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Committers, contributors, and ASF Members have a wealth of information about every aspect of software and community development.

When we share our knowledge, its reach multiplies and our effectiveness increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the infrastructure that supports all our efforts at the ASF, here are some ways to share what you know with the folks with the greatest need to hear it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your smarts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you join the &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; email list, you can help answer the many questions we receive related to our infrastructure: Where can I find X? How do I achieve Y? I am trying to do Z but getting this mystery error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues range in complexity. Any committer or ASF Member is well-positioned to answer all but the most gnarly ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the Roundtables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra holds regular roundtable discussions on important topics in the World of Infrastructure. These are not lectures, where an Infra member holds forth and everybody is supposed to sit in respectful silence. Rather, the Infra team is hoping to gain insights and guidance from members of the ASF community that will improve how the team works or a tool it is developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtables usually take place on the &lt;strong&gt;first Wednesday of each month&lt;/strong&gt;, on the &lt;code&gt;#roundtable&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack. They are available to anyone who can access the ASF workspace on Slack: basically, committers and Members.
  - Here are &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;details about the Roundtables&lt;/a&gt;, including information on joining the &lt;code&gt;#roundtable&lt;/code&gt; channel.
  - We don't record the sessions, but we do take &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable" target="_blank"&gt;copious notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build better builds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group meets regularly (usually the second Thursday of the month) in the &lt;code&gt;#builds&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack to explore issues related to builds of ASF projects' products. You are welcome whether you have a puzzle you need help solving, or some insights that may help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-vision distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is starting to develop the &lt;strong&gt;Artifacts Distribution Platform&lt;/strong&gt; (ADP). The idea is to consolidate &lt;code&gt;dist.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;downloads.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rsync.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;archive.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; into one service that will free up resources and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplify backups of release artifacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the need to "police" projects about their release pages by no longer requiring them to manually archive older releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that all new releases follow our release policies by only allowing policy-compliant artifacts to be released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easier for product users to verify that what they are about to download is a certified ASF artifact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are assembling lists of necessary features, 'good to have' features, and ambitious pipe dreams, and value input from all across the The ASF's communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join the &lt;code&gt;artifacts@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; mailing list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask to be invited to the &lt;code&gt;artifact-platform-dev&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Artifacts+Distribution+Platform" target="_blank"&gt;current collection of ideas and issues&lt;/a&gt; related to the ADP. Add your thoughts/concerns/insights in the editable pages linked to from that main page. (Note: we have already blue-skied a very complex application. If you suggest another component, we may invite you to help develop it.)&lt;/li&gt;
