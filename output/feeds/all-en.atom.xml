&lt;h3&gt;A staffing change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chis Thistlethwaite, who has been an important part of the Infrastructure team for almost nine years, is moving on to another project. His last day of work at The ASF is October 11, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris will be at Community over Code in Denver, Colorado, USA, October 7-10, so be sure to wish him good luck in his new work if you run into him there. He will continue to be active as a Member of the ASF. (Note for the record books: Chris's first week of work in 2016 involved attending ApacheCon EU in Seville, Spain.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to an &lt;a href="https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/inside-infra-chris-thistlethwaite-part" target="_blank"&gt;interview with Chris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qbot qnews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Jira features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ASF Slack workspace (the-asf.slack.com), ASF Members using channels with Qbot installed can now call up Jira tickets that match various search conditions (unassigned, related to a certain project, and so on). Details on the available commands are on the &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/qbot.html" target="_blank"&gt;Qbot page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lauren marches on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack channels with Qbot installed now also have access to 'Lauren', a member of the Human Resources department of an alternate-world ASF, in which the Foundation has a big office where Committers and Members work. Lauren can provide policy statements, review complaints, point out employee benefits, and make important (to Lauren) announcements. Lauren is very sure her information is accurate and up-to-date; you may have a different opinion. Instructions for contacting Lauren are also on the Qbot page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working with lists.apache.org&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lists.apache.org/" target="_blank"&gt;lists.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; lets you search, browse and contribute to the ASF email lists to which you have access, but it is not obvious that, for instance, you can use lists.a.o to create an email in a list to which you have subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page &lt;a href="https://email-lists.apache.org" target="_blank"&gt;Working in lists.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; explains what your access is and what options are available, and provides a list of hotkeys you can use to do what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Release artifact recommended and maximum sizes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clarity, Infra has updated the statement in the &lt;a href="release-distribution.html"&gt;Release Distribution Policy&lt;/a&gt; on release artifact sizes. The statement now reads: &lt;strong&gt;Infra recommends keeping the size of your release artifacts below 100MB. The ASF will not host release artifacts larger than 1GB.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 4, 2024 Roundtable had a focus on what barriers or challenges projects whose members are primarily in Asia or Australia meet in ASF infrastructure. A summary of the conversation is on the CWiki: &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-09-03%2C+00%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;Infra Roundtable 2024-09-03, 00:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Roundtable will be in person at the Community over Code event in Denver, Colorado, USA: &lt;strong&gt;October 8, 2:50 pm local time, Mt. Harvard Room&lt;/strong&gt;. We will not be recording the roundtable, but will publish a summary of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The HR Department&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/qbot.html"&gt;Qbot assistant&lt;/a&gt; in the ASF Slack workspace is continuing to evolve. The latest addition is &lt;strong&gt;Lauren&lt;/strong&gt;, a member of the imaginary ASF Human Resources department.

&lt;h2&gt;The HR Department&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/qbot.html"&gt;Qbot assistant&lt;/a&gt; in the ASF Slack workspace is continuing to evolve. The latest addition is &lt;strong&gt;Lauren&lt;/strong&gt;, a member of the imaginary ASF Human Resources department. Lauren occasionally appears in Infra team conversations, and we thought it would be fair to share her wisdom with the larger ASF community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren will eventually have a lot to say, but at the moment her responses are limited. You can invoke the HR department by typing 'lauren' in three consecutive messages in a Slack channel in which Qbot is already active (sort of how characters invoke a demon in the movie "Beetlejuice").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The end of 'home'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago, it was somewhat difficult for people to put personal content onto the web, so the ASF provided that feature for our committers. It was first known as &lt;code&gt;people.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; and later as &lt;code&gt;home.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;. Many ASF committers have made use of the service, and it currently holds several hundred gigabytes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there are so many options to host content that it no longer makes sense for the ASF to provide that service, and we will be turning "home" off around &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, September 12, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. We ask that anyone with content on the service to log in and download the data they want to preserve. For more information, see &lt;a href="end_of_home.html"&gt;You can't go home again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The August Roundtable discussed the informal group that is figuring out how to manage the repository for ASF-approved GitHub Actions, and what that group can provide as a model for other task-focused groups within the ASF. After discussing ideas covering practical questions and formal recognition, those present agreed that the wisest course was probably to proceed as a working group rather than trying to create a formal structure like a TLP. Notes on the conversation are available at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-08-07%2C+17%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;Infra Roundtable 2024-08-07&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;September 4, 2024, 1200UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, with a focus on what barriers or challenges projects whose members are primarily in Asia or Australia meet in ASF infrastructure. Details about joining the Roundtable are &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We ask that anyone with content on the service to log in via &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; and download the data they want to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also note that members of some projects have been using &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; as a way to share release candidates of project code. This was never the purpose of the &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; service. Please use one of the approved locations for sharing release candidates:  &lt;code&gt;dist.apache.org/dev/&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nightlies.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qbot can help you on Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infrastructure team's Qbot is a Slack assistant that can simplify both important and frivolous tasks on Slack channels in the the-asf workspace. It can support requests in channels for PMCs, ASF committees, the ASF Board and ASF members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name references the tool-maker 'Q', who provides weapons and gadgets for Agent 007 in the James Bond movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qbot has an evolving set of functions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing to the channel notifications related to your project's Jira tickets - new ticket, new comment, ticket resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding people to private channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a question queue in the huddle in a channel workspace (note that this feature is in alpha development).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has a set of 'fun' features, such as rolling dice or flipping a coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, visit &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/qbot.html" target="_blank"&gt;Qbot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The July Roundtable focused on managing the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-actions" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub repo for approved GitHub Actions developed by the ASF community&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to make it easy for a developer to add an Action to the repo as a pull request, and, after Infra verifies it, easy for any project to access and use it in its repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lively discussion covered topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should the Actions be versioned, so people can easily get the version they want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who reviews and approves submitted Actions (at the moment, it is the Infra team, but the ideal would be a team of volunteers with GHA expertise).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be clear guidelines to writing an Action that will be acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions to help with the management of the repo and the Actions, please add it to &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-ideas/tree/main" target="_blank"&gt;Infra's 'good ideas' repo&lt;/a&gt; , where others can easily comment on or extend the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a Slack channel in the 'the-asf' workspace, &lt;i&gt;asf-ghactions&lt;/i&gt;, where discussion is continuing about Actions and the management of the repo. To join in, request that Infra add you to the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete notes of the meeting are at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-07-03%2C+17%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;Infra Roundtable 2024-07-03, 17:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;August 7, 2024, 1700UTC&lt;/strong&gt;. Using the team working on the new repository for ASF GitHub Actions as an example, we will discuss developing a &lt;strong&gt;task community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More next month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A change to website creation and builds for projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ASF projects, and the Infrastructure team, have been using the ASF-pelican template and service to build and deploy their websites. Infra has decided to deprecate its customized buildsite offerings in favor of those provided by GitHub Pages. A GitHub Action provides the same Pelican features and workflow as the former service did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is offering support to help projects move from the former buildsite tool to the GitHub Action, providing a run-once migration script that adapts the website repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation about building websites with Pelican that starts at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/asf-pelican.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/asf-pelican.html&lt;/a&gt; is being updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read more about migration methods, please visit: &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Moving+from+Infrastructure-pelican+to+GitHub+Actions" target="_blank"&gt;Moving from Infrastructure-pelican to GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;, and the GHA's README file: &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-actions/blob/main/pelican/README.md" target="_blank"&gt;github.com/apache/infrastructure-actions/blob/main/pelican/README.md&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are expecting to wrap up disabling our Pelican buildsite offerings by the end of 2024. If you have any questions regarding this migration, please email us at &lt;a href="mailto:private@infra.apache.org"&gt;private@infra.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; or message us on #asfinfra in the-asf Slack space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache and HSTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is adding apache.org to Chrome's HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list, upping the security measures for the majority of visitors to our sites. This change will go into effect on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your good ideas for Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the ASF community have lots of good ideas for services Infra could provide, or improvements the team should make to existing services. To this point, there has not been a convenient way to get those ideas to where people can respond to them by supporting them, suggesting tweaks to the original idea, or explaining why they think the service or fix is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra has set up "Infrastructure-ideas" (&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-ideas" target="_blank"&gt;github.com/apache/infrastructure-ideas&lt;/a&gt;), a GitHub repository to host, discuss, and get consensus on people's ideas for ASF infrastructure. For now, we will mainly be making use of the repo's "Discussions" tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new discussion in the category that best matches it:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New ideas for services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you see a suggestion that you agree with, you can upvote it. This helps to demonstrate how broadly the community supports the idea, and that, in turn, could help Infra decide which ideas to devote resources toward implementing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to flesh out a suggestion, feel free to add a comment, a question, a challenge, a tweak to it.
We look forward to your ideas!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new ASF distribution platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra developing the Artifacts Distribution Platform (ADP). The idea is to consolidate dist.apache.org, downloads.apache.org, rsync.apache.org and archive.apache.org into one service that will free up resources and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplify backups of release artifacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the need to "police" projects about their release pages by no longer requiring them to manually archive older releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that all new releases follow our release policies by only allowing policy-compliant artifacts to be released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easier for product users to verify that what they are about to download is a certified ASF artifact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have assembled lists of necessary features, 'good to have' features, and ambitious pipe dreams, and value input from all across the The ASF's communities, and development is well underway. We expect to bring the distribution platform on-line in stages, with the first stage becoming available late in 2024 or early in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join the &lt;code&gt;artifacts@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; mailing list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask to be invited to the &lt;code&gt;artifact-platform-dev&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Artifacts+Distribution+Platform" target="_blank"&gt;current collection of ideas and issues&lt;/a&gt; related to the ADP. Add your thoughts/concerns/insights in the editable pages linked to from that main page. (Note: we have already blue-skied a very complex application. If you suggest another component, we may invite you to help develop it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the name of the platform may change before it goes live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June, 2024 Roundtable reviewed and discussed tools and resources that every PMC should consider using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual machines - the bread and butter of The ASF. Each project can use an Infra-supported virtual machine for free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfyaml" target="_blank"&gt;.asf.yaml&lt;/a&gt; - Lets project manage their own website development and many other things. .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-serve - Provides many tools for Committers, project leaders, and ASF Members.
Confluence and Jira - Wiki and ticketing system from Atlassian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache STeVe - Voting tool for the ASF and for projects. It is its own top level project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack - A project channel in the 'the-asf' space can be a communications hub for a project rather than, say, IRC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://infra-reports.apache.org" target="_blank"&gt;Infra Reports&lt;/a&gt; - Dashboard covering resource uptime, public download statistics, use of GitHub Actions, the project website resource checker, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-actions" target="_blank"&gt;Infrastructure Actions repo&lt;/a&gt; - hosts Infrastructure-approved GH Actions that all projects can use. This generated a lot of interest and suggestions from those present, so we are devoting the next Roundtable to talking through how we will manage this repository and curate its contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also touched on Non-Infra tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporter (ComDev)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache Whimsy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full notes of the meeting are at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-06-05%2C+17%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;Infra Roundtable 2024-06-05, 17:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;July 3, 2024, 1700UTC&lt;/strong&gt;. We will discuss how to manage the new repository to host ASF-approved GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infra member Chris Wells reviewed what Apache STeVe is for, and the many voting situations it can support. Its main use in the ASF is for the election of board members, but any project could easily use STeVe for project-consensus votes, such as the election of a new PMC chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris took the group through a demo of STeVe in action, with commentary ('this bit can take a while if a lot of people are eligible to vote'), and there was discussion of improvements to come with STeVe 3.0 (release date not yet announced).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was discussion of voting methods for approving a project's release candidate&amp;ndash;currently, voting takes place in an email thread. Daniel Gruno noted that the new distribution platform, ADP, will have a straightforward method for setting up, holding, and seeing the results of votes on release candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation covered legal requirements for establishing the results of a binding vote, and for recording who voted. There was also a request that ADP, when released, have a method for bulk-approval of artifacts in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full notes of the meeting are at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-05-08%2C+17%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;Infra Roundtable 2024-05-08, 17:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June Roundtable will take place &lt;strong&gt;June 5 at 1700UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, on the roundtable channel in the 'the-asf' space on Slack. The topic will be &lt;strong&gt;Top ten infrastructure resources for projects&lt;/strong&gt;. We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community Over Code 2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infrastructure team will be taking part in all three Community Over Code (CoC) events this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoC Europe, June 3-5, Bratislava, Slovakia - &lt;a href="https://eu.communityovercode.org/" target="_blank"&gt;eu.communityovercode.org&lt;/a&gt;. Three Infra team members will be present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoC Asia, July 26-28, Hangzhou, China - &lt;a href="https://asia.communityovercode.org/" target="_blank"&gt;asia.communityovercode.org&lt;/a&gt;. One Infra team member will be taking part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoC North America,  October 7-10, Denver, Colorado USA - &lt;a href="https://communityovercode.org/" target="_blank"&gt;communityovercode.org&lt;/a&gt;. The full team will be at the conference, and will be presenting a track of four talks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More news coming in the June issue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Infra Reporting Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard, at &lt;a href="https://infra-reports.apache.org/" target="_blank"&gt;infra-reports.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;, provides a collection of reports on the overall health and activity of the infrastructure at the ASF. These reports can be helpful in understanding the status of all the ASF 'under the hood' resources, and in assessing the resource cost of some activities, like build processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the reports are open to the public, while others are restricted to those who genuinely need them; see the documentation at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/infra-reports.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/infra-reports.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MFA at the ASF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is working on policies to cover use of multi-factor authorization (MFA) at The ASF, and tooling to support and enable those policies. The goal is to provide the best-possible security for user accounts at the lowest reasonable level of disruption to work processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft of the main MFA policy, with a link to the policy on restoring MFA when someone has lost a key element of it, is available at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/mfa.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/mfa.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we refine the policy and bring the tools to support it online, we will update the policy page. We will make a general announcement when we are close to bringing MFA live for The ASF and its projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no April roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May Roundtable will be on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, 1700 UTC. The topic of the day will be "How PMCs can use the STeVe voting tool", with a live demonstration. There will probably also be time for unstructured discussion about other issues and concerns related to infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Info about the roundtables is at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/roundtable.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Access to the Confluence Wiki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with the creation of spammy accounts and risks to ASF and project information on the wiki, we have limited account-creation: committers and ASF members can automatically log in to the ASF Confluence Wiki without creating an account. At the moment people who do not have an ASF LDAP account &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; create an account in the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next issue of &lt;em&gt;Inside Infra&lt;/em&gt; will appear near the end of May, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Policy change on use of GitHub Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to misconfigurations in their builds, some projects have been using unsupportable numbers of GitHub Actions. As part of fixing this situation, Infra has added a 'resource use' section to the policy on GitHub Actions. This section of the policy will come into effect on &lt;strong&gt;April 20, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workflows MUST have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 20. This means a workflow cannot have more than 20 jobs running at the same time across all matrices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workflows SHOULD have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 15. Just because 20 is the max, doesn't mean you should strive for 20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average number of minutes a project uses per calendar week MUST NOT exceed the equivalent of 25 full-time runners (250,000 minutes, or 4,200 hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average number of minutes a project uses in any consecutive five-day period MUST NOT exceed the equivalent of 30 full-time runners (216,000 minutes, or 3,600 hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects whose builds consistently cross the maximum use limits will lose their access to GitHub Actions until they fix their build configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full policy is at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html"&gt;https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Roundtable of March 3, 2024, Clay Johnson of Gradle outlined the testing features that come with Develocity, focussing on their use with Gradle and Maven. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build scan gives insights into what goes on in a build, and can help a project quickly focus on tests that are failing or flaky, and address related code issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictive test selection can speed up certain types of builds by skipping the tests that are not relevant to the build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fuller summary of this discussion, and conversation about GitHub Runners and other topics, is at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-03-06%2C+17%3A00+UTC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-03-06%2C+17%3A00+UTC"&gt;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-03-06%2C+17%3A00+UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is available to ASF Members and Committers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: There will be &lt;strong&gt;no April 2024 Roundtable&lt;/strong&gt;. The series will resume in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The end of Apache Paste Bucket?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Infra rolled out Apache Paste Bucket (&lt;code&gt;http://paste.apache.org/&lt;/code&gt;). In a blog entry at the time, we described it as an "ASF-driven site for posting snippets, scripts, logging output, configurations and much more and sharing them with the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool has seen some use over the past decade, but has had very little traffic in the last couple of years. To keep Apache Paste Bucket available, the code would require a significant upgrade. Unless we hear that the tool is important to some part of the ASF community, we plan to shut down Apache Paste in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
The next newsletter will appear toward the end of April, 2024.

&lt;h2&gt;Newsletter name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our very unscientific poll showed that "Inside Infra" has the most support as a name for this newsletter, so that is what we shall be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: in 2020 the main ASF blog published a series of interviews with Infra team members also called "Inside Infra". Links to the interviews are available at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/The+Infrastructure+team" target="_blank"&gt;The Infrastructure team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2023 year-end survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held our second annual year-end survey and got a lot of participation. Overall satisfaction with Infra's work seems high, but there were also a series of very useful suggestions and ideas. This newsletter, in fact, is a response to one of the suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey summary is on our &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/2023%20Infra%20Survey%20Results.html" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The February Roundtable focused on Keycloak and related security issues but, as is often the case, conversation also moved usefully into several other areas and concerns, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is concern that it is difficult to find a link to Infra's website, or even know that it exists, from the main ASF website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A suggestion to develop project-level security groups for GitHub Issues, based on roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be a CalDev service that would support an events calendar for each project that wants one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was discussion of trying to find a forum solution that could in time replace the requirement for email-based conversation threads for project decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The summary of the conversation is on the Infra Confluence wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Infra Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;March 6, 2024 1700 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;. The main topic, before the suggestions start to fly, will be &lt;strong&gt;improving automated testing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note: Develocity is hoping to roll out predictive test / flaky test analysis, to help projects improve their test suites so they generate more reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on how the roundtables work, and how to join in, is at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/roundtable.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;.asf.yaml info available&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.asf.yaml is an important tool in managing project websites and other services. It is a branch-specific configuration file that a project may create and put in the root of a Git repository to control features such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notification schemes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;website staging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelican builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for .asf.yaml  was on the Infra Cwiki, but is now is in its repository's README file: &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfyaml/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank"&gt;github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfyaml/blob/main/README.md&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-serve and wiki accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An addition to the Apache self-serve tool will let a user request a Cwiki account. The request goes for approval to the project the user specifies. The project can also grant the user write access, should that be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is not yet available, but is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delivery issues with Gmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are subscribed to an ASF mailing list with a Gmail account, you may experience missing list mail. This is due to changes Google made that cause rejection of ASF mailing list mail to Gmail addresses. Infra is currently investigating this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or your project experience this, Infra has a workaround which we can apply to your mailing list, but some messages may
still be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excellent questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best stuff Infra does has evolved from project members' questions and suggestions. If you have an infrastructure-related question, feel free to ask it on the &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; email list. We may share your question, and our answer to it, in a coming newslette&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's it until next month!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a summary of the responses to questions and the comments added in each section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're grateful to those who took the time to fill out the survey. Without feedback like this, the Infra team can feel a bit like it is flailing around in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary of responses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infra Roundtables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;82% of survey respondents have attended an Infra Roundtable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reasons for not having attended include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time constraints (most frequent response)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was not aware it existed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not need it / no pressing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timezone issues (the roundtables frequently happen at a time which is more convenient to people in Europe and North American than in Asia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;88.9% say the roundtables &amp;lsquo;provide value&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics respondents would like roundtables to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things Infra is working on that might be useful to PMCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerability scanning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation of
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;voting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;policy compliance verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to make it easier for contributors to projects to contribute to Infra coding tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic hackathons Infra hackathons open to all contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series of FAQs / tutorials on common tasks at the ASF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;81% agreed that Infra is getting better at open communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further communications improvement suggestions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic newsletter (implemented!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email announcements of important matters to all members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better connection of each Infra service with its documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News box on the landing page at &lt;code&gt;infra.a.o&lt;/code&gt; needs to be updated more frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions to &lt;code&gt;users@infra.a.o&lt;/code&gt; seem to go unanswered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be more consistent in showing latest and earlier versions of info on the wiki pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public archive containing summaries of all main points in all roundtables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic publication of the basic stuff, such as 'Where is self-serve?'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95% feel Infra offers adequate technical services for their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service improvement suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactively improve the security posture of all ASF projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating releases (this is coming!) and dependency upgrades for CVE mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free BSD runners and CI builder on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More docs and examples for VM setup via puppet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password management solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More powerful GitHub Action runners for all platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video call service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked which existing services need improvement. These areas got the most votes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD (Jenkins, BuildBot, GitHub Actions &amp;ndash; 62%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue Tracking (Jira, GitHubIssues, Bugzilla) &amp;ndash; 31%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation / Wiki pages &amp;ndash; 31%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source control (GitHub/GitBox, SVN) &amp;ndash; 19%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging (Slack, mailing lists) &amp;ndash; 19%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archived blog content is greatly bit rotted with no way to fix; no good modern blogging options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASF project websites vary widely in visual appeal and functionality. How to make it easier to quickly set up &amp;lsquo;modern looking&amp;rsquo; websites?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue tracking &amp;ndash; automated scripts to migrate existing issues from Jira to GitHub Issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix tool sprawl &amp;ndash; self-serve, whimsy, reporter, cveprocess...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins seems outdated. Would prefer something like Concourse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research an official Stack Overflow integration as an alternative to users&amp;rsquo; lists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In CI/CD, we don&amp;rsquo;t really have any CD. Where can we deploy test apps?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control over Docker Hub repos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds are sometimes flaky because of disk-full error, broken hardware, missing build tools...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds are very slow for projects with a large number of modules and different workflows for different test suites. Such projects need more dedicated resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy for projects to configure build pipelines that don&amp;rsquo;t work well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to create a filter to understand the context of an email from the ASF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struggling to find good documentation on Buildbot hosts, in particular for setting up a Windows build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a multilanguage project, Kotlin is not counted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mailing list noise from GitHub/GitBox. Drop messages from some bots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a simple build caching solution for Jenkins so we can cache Maven repositories between builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a good template for the static part of project websites. (Working on it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no documentation on cleanup after a build and main + subpath deployment of a website, nor an example to start with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long build queues on ASF Jenkins; problems with GHA builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins builds should be containerized and isolated from one another, so one build does not bring down a node for everybody else. Need guaranteed minimum performance for performance-sensitive build tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the messaging of Jira to the mailing lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions for projects:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope to make more frequent releases (multiple mentions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get it fully, reproducibly built with OID integration to release it via Trusted Publishing to PyPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce &amp;lsquo;onboarding barriers&amp;rsquo; and bridging projects for more synergy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add documentation tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attracting more people to work on the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Year&amp;rsquo;s hopes to get from Infra, the ASF, from your project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use and secure package and releasing platform (Working on it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An arrangement with medium or substack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD/BSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More stability for Ubuntu Jenkins nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automated voting tool (Working on it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI stabiity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More powerful GitHub Runners for all platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feedback for the Infra team:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the comments were positive, with thanks for our efforts and good wishes for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was one &amp;ldquo;Well, there is that one guy...&amp;rdquo; (working on it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who responded to our annual survey (see below) suggested that we start a newsletter to share developments and other news. The suggester thought we should send it to the &lt;code&gt;dev@&lt;/code&gt; list of every PMC and PPMC, but we are going to start with a more limited distribution and see if the benefit to readers outweighs the additional email traffic. If you would like to get each issue in your email inbox, make sure you are subscribed to &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete text of each month's newsletter appears here on the Infra blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect to see a new installment of the newsletter toward the end of each month. If you have suggestions, please share them in an email to &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Infra year-end survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we start 2024, we're using a survey to review infrastructure developments and plans for the ASF. We will compile responses into an anonymized report to share with the whole ASF community and to provide the Infrastructure team with insights that may help us improve our work in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not had a chance to fill out the survey yet, &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/rQwYykCuP3Z1ij5Z9" target="_blank"&gt;it is here&lt;/a&gt;. It will be active until &lt;strong&gt;February 2, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Infra Roundtable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year the Infrastructure team started holding monthly &lt;strong&gt;Roundtable&lt;/strong&gt; meetings, in response to requests for a way to discuss infrastructure issues and initiatives. In 2023, we held ten such meetings, usually on the first Wednesday of each month. One meeting was face-to-face, as a part of Community Over Code North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an Infra member generally makes a brief presentation on some topic, this is not the sort of gathering where we talk and talk and you meekly listen. We enjoy hearing insights from all across the ASF universe, and some very good ideas have emerged from Roundtable meetings and become part of Infra's work plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtables last an hour and take place in a huddle in the Infra channel in the Apache space on Slack. Instructions on how to join the roundtables are at &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;infra.apache.org/roundtable.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to summaries of all meetings are at &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable" target="_blank"&gt;cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Roundtable will be &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, February 7, 2024 1700 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, and we will focus on &lt;a href="https://www.keycloak.org" target="_blank"&gt;Keycloak&lt;/a&gt; and two factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infra and conferences in 2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Infra will be taking part in both &lt;strong&gt;Community over Code&lt;/strong&gt; (CoC) &lt;strong&gt;Europe&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CoC North America&lt;/strong&gt; in 2024, we will not be able to send team members to &lt;strong&gt;CoC Asia&lt;/strong&gt;. It would be great if anyone attending could pass on to us, by email or through our Slack channel, insights or issues discussed at the conference that are relevant to Infra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in a name?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we call this thing? "The Infra Newsletter" is straightforward, but maybe not all that catchy. "Infractions", while being a cute mashup of "Infra" and "actions", may not be clear to readers for whom English is not their best language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/TCEDGdE9VHM45CGJA" target="_blank"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to vote for a name you prefer for the Infra newsletter: The poll is on Google Drive, but you do not have to log in to use it. The poll will stay open until &lt;strong&gt;February 5, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When we share our knowledge, its reach multiplies and our effectiveness increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the infrastructure that supports all our efforts at the ASF, here are some ways to share what you know with the folks with the greatest need to hear it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your smarts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you join the &lt;code&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; email list, you can help answer the many questions we receive related to our infrastructure: Where can I find X? How do I achieve Y? I am trying to do Z but getting this mystery error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues range in complexity. Any committer or ASF Member is well-positioned to answer all but the most gnarly ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the Roundtables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra holds regular roundtable discussions on important topics in the World of Infrastructure. These are not lectures, where an Infra member holds forth and everybody is supposed to sit in respectful silence. Rather, the Infra team is hoping to gain insights and guidance from members of the ASF community that will improve how the team works or a tool it is developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtables usually take place on the &lt;strong&gt;first Wednesday of each month&lt;/strong&gt;, on the &lt;code&gt;#roundtable&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack. They are available to anyone who can access the ASF workspace on Slack: basically, committers and Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are &lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank"&gt;details about the Roundtables&lt;/a&gt;, including information on joining the &lt;code&gt;#roundtable&lt;/code&gt; channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't record the sessions, but we do take &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable" target="_blank"&gt;copious notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build better builds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group meets regularly (usually the second Thursday of the month) in the &lt;code&gt;#builds&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack to explore issues related to builds of ASF projects' products. You are welcome whether you have a puzzle you need help solving, or some insights that may help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-vision distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is starting to develop the &lt;strong&gt;Artifacts Distribution Platform&lt;/strong&gt; (ADP). The idea is to consolidate &lt;code&gt;dist.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;downloads.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rsync.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;archive.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; into one service that will free up resources and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplify backups of release artifacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the need to "police" projects about their release pages by no longer requiring them to manually archive older releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that all new releases follow our release policies by only allowing policy-compliant artifacts to be released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easier for product users to verify that what they are about to download is a certified ASF artifact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are assembling lists of necessary features, 'good to have' features, and ambitious pipe dreams, and value input from all across the The ASF's communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join the &lt;code&gt;artifacts@infra.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; mailing list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask to be invited to the &lt;code&gt;artifact-platform-dev&lt;/code&gt; channel in the &lt;code&gt;the-ASF&lt;/code&gt; workspace on Slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Artifacts+Distribution+Platform" target="_blank"&gt;current collection of ideas and issues&lt;/a&gt; related to the ADP. Add your thoughts/concerns/insights in the editable pages linked to from that main page. (Note: we have already blue-skied a very complex application. If you suggest another component, we may invite you to help develop it.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradle, a longtime leader in developer productivity and build analytics, has become a platinum-level sponsor of the ASF. The ASF instance of Develocity, formerly Gradle Enterprise, is at &lt;a href="https://ge.apache.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ge.apache.org"&gt;https://ge.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But what is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develocity is a suite of acceleration and analytics technologies for CI/CD  systems to help projects identify and analyze trends while optimizing build resources. The result is faster builds, with fewer failures,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does Develocity do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a five-fold approach to optimization, Develocity scans, ingests, and caches build data, which it then analyzes. It displays the results in an an easy-to-use interface where project members can identify bottlenecks and roadblocks. You can also leverage cached results to ensure that only changes in each new build are tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach results in faster feedback and less use of build resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do projects integrate Develocity into their builds?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good resource is &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Project+Onboarding+Instructions+for+Develocity" target="_blank"&gt;Project Onboarding Instructions for Develocity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your project runs into difficulties or has questions, open a Jira ticket for Infra. If we can't help with your issue ourselves, we can draw on the ASF's community of Gradle users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do projects make use of Develocity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a project has integrated Develocity into their build process, scans of each new build are sent to the instance at &lt;code&gt;ge.apache.org&lt;/code&gt;. Project members can review the build scan dashboard's graphic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do we expect this to impact us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that, with increased insight into build processes, projects will see build time savings across all jobs, reducing queue times and driving down time spent building serially or dealing with build failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're announcing a new look for selfserve.apache.org today! It's a completely updated site, featuring a new layout which we hope will suit everyone better. The new update also cleans up a some tech debt we've had with the old site, so adding new features or integrations should be easier for us to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;New Features&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the new features we've also rolled out on selfserve.apache.org is the ability for someone to request a &lt;a href="https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html"&gt;public Jira account&lt;/a&gt; through the page! We've been trying to develop a way to fight spammers and bad actors for a while on Jira and we know based on feedback that turning off the public signup link has caused some new issues. This is a brand new process whereby someone (existing committer or not) can fill out the form, add some detail as to why they are asking for access, and then a mail is sent to the PMC to approve or deny the request. The requester gets updated when their account is approved or denied, with the PMC having the ability to reply with a reason for denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://selfserve.apache.org"&gt;Feel free to check it out&lt;/a&gt;, tell your friends, break it and email &lt;a href="mailto:users@infra.apache.org"&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; with any details! Fun for the entire family!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank everyone who took time to take the survey. This is the first time that I know of that we've tried something like this, and feedback is very important. I'd also like to take a second to clarify my tone for this article. I'm presenting as Chris T. the Infra person, not as an ASF Member or committer. So when I say "we" or "us", I'm referring to the other Infra folks, not specifically the Foundation as a whole or any Members. I am not posting the full results, but a summary of the data, as we had some responses that used enough information to identify the person being discussed. Those responses are 100% valid and I don't want to post an incomplete dataset with them removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary of Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sent the survey to 4109 people (and anyone who went to the blog post would also have been able to complete the survey) and received 80 responses. While that isn't a huge number of results, it's a very manageable dataset to parse through. I also presume that some people submitting responses were conveying information gathered from other participants in their project. There weren't many surprises in responses, as we all know a lot of the pain points. However, it's vital for the Infra team to have data to back up our work and the resources we offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top subjects that were referred to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public Jira access is a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication is a problem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open/Public Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Infra communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD is a problem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity/Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platforms (Jenkins, Buildbot, GHA, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release process is a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charts reflect the data above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="../images/image1.png" width="450"/&gt;
&lt;img src="../images/image2.png" width="450"/&gt;
&lt;img src="../images/image3.png" width="450"/&gt;
&lt;img src="../images/image4.png" width="450"/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy thing would be to say, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s fix all the things!&amp;rdquo; To be honest, there is on-going work with all the above issues, but most of them are not subject to a quick fix or a short answer. Now that we have data and a baseline, we&amp;rsquo;ll evaluate and discuss how we&amp;rsquo;re going to address your concerns. Since that I&amp;rsquo;ve never done one of these surveys before, I do not have the next steps laid out, so we&amp;rsquo;ll have to take them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Roundtable Discussions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra is proposing to hold a monthly roundtable of free-flowing discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our idea right now is that each roundtable event will take place in a Slack huddle and will last an hour.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
The first (shorter) part will be Infra talking about a topic of interest, something we are planning, or a problem we are facing.
Then we'll open the floor for everyone to talk about that topic... and about anything else infrastructure-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll create a bullet-point summary of what we talked about, and will make the summaries available in our CWiki space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surveys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd also like to start using regular surveys to get to understand the heart of the problems that our projects and podlings face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan with surveys is two-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to get a finger on the pulse of projects and a "2022 year in review" baseline. Since this is the first time we're trying this. it's likely that future surveys will contain different questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we'll be sending out surveys on a regular basis, something like every six months or so, just to keep a feedback loop going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys will be anonymous and results will be posted on the Infra blog. Depending on timing, they will also be discussed in the roundtables if the data is pertinent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infra.apache.org/surveys/survey-1.html"&gt;You can find the survey here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not done lightly. The main reason for this is the amount of spam and spam accounts that are created every day, it has
made managing Jira a big effort. In addition, Infra are planning with Atlassian to move to their Cloud service, where account
limitations apply; and our current self hosted instance is around 150000 users above the limit required for migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily spam account creations undermine our efforts to reduce the user counts and so we must stop the creation of the spam
accounts themselves, not just the spam issues/comments created from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects have for a long time wanted a resolution to the spam problems that plague their Jira Projects, often these spam issues
and comments go unnoticed, and the added attraction to spammers is that all issues get copied to mailing list archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, until such a time as we migrate to Atlassian Cloud, we ask that Projects themselves take on the task of creating
the Jira account requests that come in. Projects are encouraged but not required to create a dedicated private mailing list where
users can email to ask for an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an account has been created, that user is then automatically whitelisted to create issues anywhere within our Jira instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate that this is not as convenient as having public signups on, but we must do this in order to move forward and to
stop the spam in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any questions or concerns please feel free to email &lt;a href="mailto:users@infra.apache.org"&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASF Infrastructure Team&lt;/p&gt;

I was born in Flint, Michigan, but I have moved around a bit between then and now. I lived in Southern California and Per&amp;uacute; for a little while and attended school at Northern Michigan University in Michigan&amp;rsquo;s Upper Peninsula. After all that, I realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt most comfortable in Mid-Michigan, so, here I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Family members?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wife, four children, three cats, three budgies, and a dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What was your start date?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 1st, 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where were you working before here?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Genesee District Library. I served as the IT Manager for the library, which is the third largest in Michigan by total population served. I used to tell people that &amp;ldquo;if it blinked or beeped, and it stopped doing either, we would fix it.&amp;rdquo; Across the 19 buildings of the library system our three-person team took care of public/staff workstations, phones, surveillance cameras, printers, and all the servers and networking equipment required to connect them. We also did staff training programs and liaised with outside vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is this your first time working as part of a remote team?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked asynchronously with a remote team, but not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked remotely. Before working at the library I worked with a small hosting company doing sysadmin type work. While at the library I advocated for a rotating hybrid schedule (2 days onsite, 3 remote) for my team in an effort to reduce the chance of our whole department being quarantined/sick simultaneously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What was the attraction of the ASF for you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASF is the nexus point to so many projects that get used in so many places. Knowing I could help move that work along was very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you been involved in the open-source world before now?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been using open-source software since the mid-90s, when I discovered Linux. I have only begun contributing to open-source projects within the last 10 years, and even those contributions were pretty minor. It feels really good to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you bring to the work?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a strong distaste for miscommunication, so I try to be an effective communicator. Additionally, I love solving problems and helping people get the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any big surprises so far?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest surprise so far has been how nice it is to work in an environment where I don&amp;rsquo;t have to know everything and the work is spread out. In my last job I managed a very small team and we were stretched pretty thin most days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will you be at ApacheCon North America 2022, and can people meet you there?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am planning to attend ACNA 2022 and look forward to meeting a bunch of people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The migration took around 35 minutes to complete, and while completely seamless and hidden to most users, it does add some new features that we have not had before, as well as redesigning some existing ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;﻿New, faster hardware behind the scenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;The first big change is the change in the hardware powering our services. We have more than tripled our computing performance, increased our disk read/write throughput by more than 17x, and increased our network throughput ten-fold. In basic terms, this means we can process pushes of new commit much faster, whether they originate from GitHub or are pushed directly to gitbox by a committer, both in terms of storing them, but also in terms of communicating the changes to our end-users, the developers. It also makes our service much more resilient towards high demands at peak office hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;﻿New, modern, and modular micro-services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;﻿While this sounds like a game of "buzzword bingo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;", it really represents many months of careful planning and upgrading of the complex designs behind GitBox, pushing them into the very forefront of back-end synchronization setups. All of our main components (code synchronization, event notification, provenance and quality assurance communications, as well as repository and account management) have been split into distinct "pipservices", which is a term we use internally at the Apache Infrastructure Team for denoting single packages of services, or "apps", that are installed and run independently of each other. These all tie into our configuration management system, and can be enabled, tweaked/upgraded or disabled quickly and as demand dictates. This change simplifies our day-to-day workflows and allows to much easier assessment of resource consumption and aids debugging by separating both processes and security environments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;New unified portal for all repository and account management needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;﻿With GitBox version 2 we have also launched a new portal for managing repositories and accounts, called Boxer. With Boxer, our developers can link their GitHub accounts with their Apache credentials, providing them with write access to GitHub. We have removed the old, cumbersome process of linking, and replaced with a flow-based approach that instantly allows a new developer to join a team. Where the old process typically required hours of waiting for our central team management system to catch up, linking and getting slotted into the right teams can now be done in a matter of minutes, if not seconds, and requires no other action than visiting our Boxer portal on gitbox.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Private git repositories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;﻿A final &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;thing we'd like to mention is the new ability for projects to use a private git repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt; for issues or a more sensitive nature. Each project can now have their own private repository space, available to the entire PMC for whatever need they may find themselves in. At present, this will require asking the infrastructure team, as we'd like to work with projects to ensure the best handling of sensitive information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;We continuously strive to better ourselves and provide state-of-the-art services and thinking, and it is our sincere hope that these upgrades will prove useful for the developers at the foundation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;If there are any questions on these changes, we ask that you reach out to us at users@infra.apache.org with your feedback/questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;With warm regards and excitement,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Daniel, on behalf of the Infrastructure Team at the Apache Software Foundation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

team is constantly looking for ways to do its work more quickly while
maintaining the ASF standards of reliability, security, and

the better it is for the whole community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As an example,
when a project starts out with the ASF, it normally begins as a
&amp;ldquo;podling&amp;rdquo; in the ASF incubator. Here it can start to create its
code, standard practices, and work methods in a development sandbox. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once the project
develops a large-enough community of committers and contributors, and
seems to be viable, it can request promotion to top-level-project
(TLP) status. This is a great moment for the project and for the ASF,
but it also used to involve a considerable amount of work for Infra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Infra Administrator
Greg Stein recalls that, at the beginning, the promotion &amp;ldquo;process&amp;rdquo;
was no more than a checklist of about thirty &amp;ldquo;fiddly steps&amp;rdquo;, each
of which required someone to do one or several manual tasks during
which any number of things could go wrong. It was considered great
progress when the checklist reduced to twenty manual steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Significant
improvements included simplifications of tasks related to mailing
lists in 2010 and LDAP simplifications in 2016, but even as recently
as 2017 the promotion process involved an Infra team member&amp;rsquo;s
engagement in many steps over the course of two or three hours. This
is what each component required for the promotion of Apache Ranger
that year:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/mediaresource/2fbf5326-1e4b-4dfa-a565-f81fb3028357"&gt;&lt;img alt="promote2017.png" src="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/mediaresource/2fbf5326-1e4b-4dfa-a565-f81fb3028357?t=true" style="width: 25%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;Between then and now
the team has improved automation of the various steps, especially
with the introduction of &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/git+-+.asf.yaml+features" target="_blank"&gt;asf.yaml&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;configuration files to simplify publishing project websites. In
2020 the same promotion process, for Apache ShardingSphere, took a
grand total of &lt;b&gt;four minutes&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/mediaresource/53eb7318-305c-4ace-831e-c0bfd6a679b4"&gt;&lt;img alt="promote2020.png" src="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/mediaresource/53eb7318-305c-4ace-831e-c0bfd6a679b4?t=true" style="width: 25%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;Infra member Daniel
Gruno says, &amp;ldquo;The majority of the work is just a click of a button
by the ASF secretary nowadays, and then the few remaining bits can
take between five and sixty minutes to complete.&amp;rdquo; That range
reflects the fact that no two projects have the same profile, system
requirements, and performance expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;These improvements

&lt;p&gt;Along with this notification scheme feature, we have also launched some corrective measures for repositories where github activity did not result in proper relaying to our mailing lists, so some projects may start seeing event messages that did not appear before. Furthermore, we are now combining review comments into single emails, to lessen the load in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASF Infrastructure Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For users, this will largely go unnoticed, and for projects likely the same; but we did want to mention the changes we've made:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of March, 2020, we are deprecating www.apache.org/dist/ in favor of https://downloads.apache.org/ for backup downloads as well as signature and checksum verification. The primary driver has been splitting up web site visits and downloads to gain better control and offer a better service for both downloads and web site visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not impact end-users, and should have a minimal impact on projects, as our download selectors as well as visits to www.apache.org/dist/ have been adjusted to make use of downloads.apache.org instead. We are asking that projects, in their own time-frame, change references on their own web sites from www.apache.org/dist/ to downloads.apache.org wherever such references may exist, to complete the switch in full. We will &lt;b&gt;not &lt;/b&gt;be turning off www.apache.org/dist/ in the near future, but would greatly appreciate if projects could help us transition away from the old URLs in their documentation and on their download pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#upload-ci" target="_blank"&gt;standard way of uploading releases&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will still apply, however there may be a short delay (&amp;lt;= 15 minutes) for technical reasons between the release and when releases show up on downloads.apache.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this change, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at users@infra.apache.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right; "&gt;With regards,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right; "&gt;Daniel on behalf of ASF Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;

The Infrastructure team (Infra) works behind the scenes to make it possible for Apache's galaxy of committers to do the cool stuff they do, and for the open-source world to get, use, and rely on applications Apache projects produce. Infra supports additions to code repositories, a constant stream of conversation among project committers and contributors, and about 100 terabytes a month of software downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infra provides not just services, but knowledge. Infra's team and project committers rely on clear and accurate documentation about everything from how to update personal information to how to keep the Apache servers online, secure, and speedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20 years of work, however, Infra has built up a substantial quantity of documentation that may be hard for its intended audience to find, out of date, or no longer relevant. So, in December, 2019, the ASF hired Andrew Wetmore as a part-time &lt;strong&gt;Technical Writer-Editor.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;His job is to curate the existing documentation and, in coordination with the rest of the Infra team and the wider ASF community, extend and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew is a member of the PMC of &lt;a href="https://royale.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache Royale"&gt;Apache Royale&lt;/a&gt;, and spent fifteen years leading QA and documentation teams for software projects ranging from kitchen-table startups to major corporations. He lives in rural Nova Scotia, on the east coast of Canada, where he is the editor of a small publishing house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 31st 2019, the machine hosting our subversion-to-git mirrors and synchronization process for GitHub suffered a catastrophic drive error due to a power failure at our data center in Virginia. The power failure was, unfortunately, of such a nature, that recovering the disk data was not possible. Four days into the failure, on September 4th 2019, we received confirmation from the data center that the data redundancy had also failed, meaning we had no measure of restoring to a new disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Currently, all GitHub mirrors that originate in subversion, and thus relied on this service, are not being synchronized with their subversion source. As git relies on on-disk subversion meta-data, as opposed to in-repo, we are not able to obtain the meta-data and continue synchronizing unless a full recreation of the mirrors is performed. This means starting from the first revision in any given subversion repository and working towards the most current one, a process that may well take a few days or weeks, depending on the size of the repository (by number of commits) and the number of running jobs at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we intend to do, going forward &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our most immediate action has been to revisit off-site backup strategies to ensure that our services are as resilient as possible, as well as re-assess and re-categorize various machines with regards to backup strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With backups revisited, and on the more long-term side of things, discussions have been centered around what we want to offer, and how that will shape our design of the system. We want to balance the need for features against robustness and speed at the core of the service, as well as perform some fall cleaning of the service, and as such, the Infrastructure team has decided to restart the service with a blank slate, incorporating features as the needs arise and are discussed. We will also be reaching out to the projects with subversion-to-git mirrors currently on GitHub, and ask for a positive confirmation that they wish to continue with this service, so as to clean up the number of repositories that are no longer in use. We are also redesigning the core service, coupling it tighter with our subversion offerings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We estimate the git mirror service to be revamped and rebooted in a matter of weeks, as cycles allow (this is occurring in tandem with other service upgrades, which puts the timeline somewhat into the future), and will add mirror repositories on an ad-hoc basis as requests come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notable changes to service offering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are starting with a blank slate, please be advised of the following changes to the service as it starts back up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will no longer be a &lt;a href="http://git.apache.org"&gt;git.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; URL for git mirrors, to lessen the confusion with &lt;a href="http://gitbox.apache.org"&gt;gitbox.apache.org.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Projects wishing to point to a git copy of their subversion repository should use their respective GitHub URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repositories are re-created from scratch. As such, it may take days from a recreation is started till the sync process begins to kick in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A little bit of history&lt;/h2&gt;The Apache Software Foundation started experimenting with git as a source code repository system in 2008, and ventured into GitHub in 2010, where we were graciously offered whatever resources we needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, this was merely a mirror of our existing git and subversion repositories, but as time went on, and projects expressed an interest in utilizing the many user-friendly features of GitHub, we started work on enabling projects to make proper use of GitHub some three years ago in the middle of 2016. This project, aptly named `gitbox`, ensured that committers could make full use of the GitHub features, while we kept a place within our own infrastructure for people inclined to continue using our infrastructure for their work. As git is decentralized by its very nature, we were able to use GitHub to augment rather than replace our git workflow, bringing our software development to the millions of users on GitHub in addition to the existing Apache community and committers, on a case-by-case basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2018, we made the decision to combine the two different git service offerings we had into one service, allowing all Apache projects to use GitHub if they so desired. Before then, we had two distinct git services: gitbox and git-wip-us, the initial git service that had been available since 2010. We coordinated the move from git-wip to gitbox with the various Apache projects, and in early 2019 we had migrated all projects to the new service, enabling GitHub features for all git-based Apache projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub in 2018, and their commitment to help strengthen open source development, we have received additional resources to help lower the bar for contributions, and we'd like to thank GitHub for their support of the Apache Software Foundation through all nine years of using their platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you as a committer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As stated above, our GitHub integration is an augmentation of our existing service. It is available to all committers on git-based projects to make use of, should they so wish. All new git repositories will automatically be available on both GitHub and Gitbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those wishing to take full advantage of GitHub's features, one can link their GitHub and Apache accounts through &lt;a href="https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/"&gt;https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/&lt;/a&gt; which will grant their GitHub account write access to the repositories you'd traditionally have access to at Apache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People that wish to continue using their Apache committer accounts to commit code may continue doing so on gitbox.apache.org with their Apache credentials. Nothing has changed in that respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Apache is a very email-centered organization, all GitHub activity is naturally linked to our mailing lists to ensure the same level of openness in the development of our software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you as a user of Apache software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many projects, the move to GitHub means a lower bar to both contributing as well as troubleshooting and submitting issues to the projects, through the GitHub issue and pull request features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our commitment to provenance, quality and open governance remains the same, and with our tight integration with GitHub through our linked account service, we are able to bring what made Apache a mark of quality to the many users and contributors on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions, comments, remarks or feedback about this, we welcome you to reach out to the Apache Infrastructure Team at: &lt;a href="mailto:users@infra.apache.org"&gt;users@infra.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our foundation grows, so do the number of users and robots utilizing our services. In order to accommodate as many as possible with what resources we have, we have opted to implement rate-limiting to ensure that everyone can get their fair share of use of our services across the globe. The first services to have rate-limiting implemented are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JIRA (issues.apache.org)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MoinMoin Wiki (wiki.apache.org)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BugZilla (bz.apache.org)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you are a normal user of our services:&lt;/h3&gt;This very likely will never affect you, and you can go about your business just like normal :) If you DO experience errors or 429 (rate limited) response codes, please do let us know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you are a robot or otherwise automated tool:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now limits in place for how much CPU time you can use, varying from service to service. If you get limited, you will receive a HTTP 429 response instead of the normal 200, and a short text blob will explain that you have crossed our resource limits and have been rate-limited. It will also explain why, and when you can expect to be unblocked again (generally within two minutes time). Scrapers, bots etc using our services should check for a 429 response code and act accordingly (or just slow down the discovery pace in general, as that benefits all of us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A general note about the rate limiting system, now and in the future:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate limits are applied across IP blocks to discourage distributed abuse, thus if you have 1.2.3.4 abusing a service, 1.2.3.5 would potentially also be affected by the rate limits till they expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this year, we will be rolling out rate limits on more services, and we encourage people automating tasks to honor the 429 responses across all ASF services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to point out that there are, as before, additional global limits in place regarding the use of our services, which can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infra-ban.html"&gt;https://www.apache.org/dev/infra-ban.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All repositories will be moved to the new gitbox service which includes direct write access on github as well as the standard ASF commit access via gitbox.apache.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this move?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move comes as a result of retiring the git-wip service, as the hardware it runs on is longing for retirement. In lieu of this, we have decided to consolidate the two services (git-wip and gitbox), to ease the management of our repository systems and future-proof the underlying hardware. The move is fully automated, and ideally, nothing will change in your workflow other than added features and access to GitHub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeframe for relocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, we are asking that projects voluntarily request to move their repositories to gitbox. The voluntary time frame is between now and January 9th 2019, during which projects are free to either move over to gitbox or stay put on git-wip. After this phase, we will be requiring the remaining projects to move within one month, after which we will move the remaining projects over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To have your project moved in this initial phase, you will need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consensus in the project (documented via the mailing list)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File a JIRA ticket with INFRA to voluntarily move your project repos over to gitbox (as stated, this is highly automated and will take between a minute and an hour, depending on the size and number of your repositories)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up the preliminary timeline;&lt;span style="background-color: #02ff00;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #02ff00;"&gt;December 9th 2018 -&amp;gt; January 9th 2019: Voluntary (coordinated) relocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #ffff00;"&gt;January 9th -&amp;gt; February 6th: Mandated (coordinated) relocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #ff0000;"&gt;February 7th: All remaining repositories are mass migrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This timeline may change to accommodate various scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using GitHub with ASF repositories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your project has moved, you are free to use either the ASF repository system (gitbox.apache.org) OR GitHub for your development and code pushes. To be able to use GitHub, please follow the primer at: &lt;a href="https://reference.apache.org/committer/github"&gt;https://reference.apache.org/committer/github&lt;/a&gt; We appreciate your understanding of this issue, and hope that your project can coordinate voluntarily moving your repositories in a timely manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All settings, such as commit mail targets, issue linking, PR notification schemes etc will automatically be migrated to gitbox as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you all for your interest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) seeks to fill an Infrastructure Systems Administrator position. You will be responsible for working with the existing technical infrastructure team.&amp;nbsp; The ASF manages a world-wide network of open source software which includes more than 1600 software code repositories, a worldwide distribution and mirroring system for software, change management, issue tracking, and software management for 300+ open source initiatives and over 10,000 contributors around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applicants should have a strong background in Computer and Information Science, and should be familiar with modern DevOps environments. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to work in a remote team environment alongside others working in diverse locations around the world and in different timezones. The successful applicant will work with the existing Infrastructure team to manage the ASF's critical infrastructure and resources. Infrastructure team members are expected to work a weekly on-call rotation with the rest of the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our infrastructure team also supports our broader community by enabling the creation of self-service tooling. The successful candidate will be able to balance the needs of our critical infrastructure and the needs of our community to self-serve. These two demands can often be in conflict and thus an ability to navigate such complex environments is a distinct advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Familiarity with Puppet (or a similar configuration management tool) Linux (Ubuntu-based), Virtual Machines, Subversion/Git, Python, and full development environment stacks are a requirement. Further, the candidate should possess great documentation skills and should be well versed in not only developing and assisting in technical solutions, but in documenting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daily tasks will include handling of alarms, outages, and security concerns on a timely basis; working with our many communities on their needs and issues; managing tickets on a timely basis; rolling out and upgrading services; reducing our large technical debt; and maintaining a professional and collegial atmosphere. The team coordinates primarily through daily chat usage, weekly meetings, and email. Social skills and ability to integrate closely with the team are expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preferred qualifications include a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar background from an accredited university, though demonstrable and appropriate on-the-job experience is an acceptable substitute for formal qualifications. Familiarity with how open source communities work is a definite positive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English as a spoken and written language is required in order to facilitate team collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a remote work position, the ASF does not require nor provide office locations. Travel once per year is required, for a team meetup and will typically be coincident with an Apache conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to &lt;a href="#Jenkins"&gt;[Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;], it has long been known that [polling must die].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could go and create post commit hooks in all the ASF hosted Git repositories, that is something that realistically is just creating an added maintenance burden.

When it comes to &lt;a href="#Jenkins"&gt;[Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;], it has long been known that [polling must die].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could go and create post commit hooks in all the ASF hosted Git repositories, that is something that realistically is just creating an added maintenance burden.
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we have [GitPubSub]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes, how do we integrate [GitPubSub] with [Jenkins]?
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, ASF committer stephenc is also an active committer to the [Jenkins] project and created a [plugin] that connects to [GitPubSub] parses the events and passes them through to the Jenkins [SCM API].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does this mean?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You can turn your Git polling down - way way down - to something like once per day.
This should significantly reduce the load on both the ASF git servers and builds.apache.org&lt;br/&gt;* Your builds will be triggered in seconds rather than having to wait for the next polling run.&lt;br/&gt;* You can try out using Multi-branch projects much like the [Maven] project has been doing for [Maven core] and [Maven Surefire]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the reaction to this change proves positive, the next step will be to integrate SvnPubSub with Jenkins and bring the benefits to the Subversion based projects too
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. We upgraded the Apache Roller software from 5.0.3 to the latest 5.1.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. We enabled LDAP for logins. That's right! Every single ASF Committer can now just login! No more creating an INFRA Jira ticket just to get a Roller account on &lt;a href="http://blogs.apache.org"&gt;blogs.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Other stuff remains the same - meaning if you are a Blog Administrator you still need to invite committers into your blog, you still need to choose to make them an Author or Admin etc - Roller doesn't support anything more than login auth for LDAP currently - but I bet the &lt;a href="https://roller.apache.org" title="roller project website"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; would love to see the LDAP integration extended and improved if you feel the need!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, our first new year present to our ASF Committers, a shiny updated blog instance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Enjoy, and have a great 2017!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure condition arises when the database connection pool is exhausted, despite being configured and sized appropriately. These connections all appear idle, but when the pool is full, no new connections can be established, and the instance falls over, requiring a restart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working closely with Atlassian, the creator of JIRA, to remedy the situation. Unfortunately, this requires running diagnostics on the production JIRA instance, which in and of itself causes performance degradation and downtime. Over the past several days, we've identified and implemented some changes to the pool parameters which we hope will help stabilize the instance while we continue our diagnostic work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that there may still be some moments of downtime and occasional restarts. Any longer duration outages will be announced via Twitter/infrabot and status.apache.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues we are seeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull requests not being closed when they should be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes not being synced to the GitHub mirrors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots other than asfgit closing PRs on Apache GitHub mirrors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking into why changes are not being synced, as well as why PRs are not getting closed and why some PRs are being closed by other bots such as hubot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will update this blog post as we get more information about the sync issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement buildbot master is now live. The CMS service and the &lt;a href="http://ci.apache.org"&gt;ci.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; website have been restored. The project CI builds are mostly working but builds that upload docs, snapshots etc. to the buildmaster for publishing are likely to fail at the upload stage while we ensure all the necessary directory structures are in place to receive the uploads. Work to resolve these final few issues is ongoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to try and contact the owner of the account where the IRC proxy was running. In case their account has been compromised, it remains locked. In addition, all their commits have been reviewed by other project committers and that review has confirmed that no malicious commits have been made by the account in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review of &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; is ongoing. No evidence of compromise beyond the possible compromise of the single, non-privileged user account has been found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original post (2015-06-29 ~21.00 UTC):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the e-mails to committers@ earlier today, &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; is currently offline after a report was received that suspicious network traffic had been observed from that host. This blog post will be updated as more information becomes known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What we know:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At ~16.00 UTC 28 June 2015 a report of suspicious network activity from a buildbot host was reported to the Apache security team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further information was requested and at ~18.00 UTC 28 June 2015 the Apache Infrastructure team received a copy of network logs that showed a number of suspicious IRC connections originating from aegis.apache.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These IRC connections were traced to a non-privileged user account on &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; running an open IRC proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At ~20.00 UTC 28 June 2015 the user account concerned was locked for all ASF services and the proxy process terminated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At ~10.00 UTC 29 June 2015, after further discussion within the infrastructure team, aegis.apache.org was taken off-line as a precaution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether the open IRC proxy was installed by the user that owned the account or whether their account was compromised and the IRC proxy was installed by an unauthorized user. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth stressing that no further information came to light between 20.00 UTC 28 June 2015 and 10.00 UTC 29 June 2015 that triggered the decision to take the host off-line. The host was taken off-line purely as a precaution while we reviewed the available information. That process is ongoing. So far we have found no evidence to even suggest anything more than a user account being used to run an IRC proxy and plenty of evidence that suggests that this was the only activity this account was used for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risks:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no risk to released source or binaries for any ASF project. There are multiple reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buildbot is a CI system used to build snapshots, not releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no builds are performed on &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildbot is used to build some project web sites and / or project documentation. The risk of compromise here is viewed as very low for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the builds do not take place on aegis.apache.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diffs of every change are sent to the relevant project team's mailing list for review and an unexpected / malicious change would be spotted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project impact:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The following services are currently off-line and will remain so until the buildbot master is restored&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All buildbot builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects that use the CMS will be unable to update their web sites (the CMS uses buildbot to build web site updates)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://ci.apache.org"&gt;ci.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work in progress:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; is going to take time and, while we view the chances of a wider compromise of this host as very, very small, we are not willing to bring the host back on line at this point. This host was due for replacement so the decision has been taken to pull this work forward and rebuild the buildbot master on a new host now. We have taken this decision not because we believe &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; to be compromised, but because it is possible to complete this work far more quickly than it is possible to confirm our view that &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org is not compromised.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; We currently estimate that the rebuild of the new buildbot master host will be completed by 1 July 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to analyze the information we have obtained from &lt;a href="http://aegis.apache.org"&gt;aegis.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and from other sources and will update this blog post as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions, concerns, comments etc. should be directed to infrastructure@apache.org &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 covers all components of the service except the listserv service, and mail archives. &amp;nbsp;These will be included in phase 2, which we will come onto later. When we started out on this project to review, update and manage our email infrastructure we had a several guiding principals that either the old system must be made to conform too; or any new service would need to meet before being accepted. &amp;nbsp;When we talk about these principals really we are talking about criteria, these are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service must be entirely managed (operationally) from our puppet service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software (packages) must all be packaged - i.e. .deb's, either upstream or packaged locally and in our own repo. Deploying from source is no longer acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the work carried out by puppet et al must be idempotent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not allow the service design to restrict our ability to either adapt it, or grow it at will and on demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very early on in the design and testing work it became clear that we needed clear separation of each of the roles in the email service infrastructure. This would allow us, in the future too add more capability of any given type if for some reason it were needed. Lets say for example we needed for SpamAssassin capability this can we scaled sideways and allow us to swallow the load without needing to also make it an MX host or listserv host etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design we have settled upon, with phase 1 complete can be seen in this diagram. &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/mailflow.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.apache.org/dev/mailflow.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- This diagram shows that we have deployed several MX hosts (each of which are more than capable of handling our entire inbound mail load comfortably); in differing AWS regions globally. This decision means that while we dont need 3 to cope with capacity we wanted 3 to cope with networking resilience should any of these instances suffer network degradation or outage. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These MX hosts are simple Postfix instances that run &lt;a href="http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html" target="_blank"&gt;Postfix Postscreen&lt;/a&gt;, RBL checks, and &lt;a href="http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/" target="_blank"&gt;Amavisd-new&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This simple protection of only performing RBL checks at the edge frees up the internal scanning hosts from having to scan emails needlessly. Amavis is simply used to pass the emails internally for scanning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the mails have been passed on by the MX (and there is an interesting detail about how exactly the mails are handled by Amavis that might be a blog post in the near future) they are handled by our scanning cluster. This group of hosts utilise SpamAssassin, ClamAV and again Postfix. While these may not be new technologies, again having a dedicated host or hosts in our case allows us to tune the services specifically for the resources dedicated to scanning and not worry about choking other local services. Of course it also means that should we see a marked increase in mail volume we can easily deploy a new node in a matter of minutes and have it join the rotation and start scanning email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the scanning nodes are being fronted by a HAProxy instance, this allows us to load balance our nodes and not have to reconfigure the MX hosts should we change the number of scanning hosts. &amp;nbsp;It also means we can take a node out of rotation for maintenance and none of the MX hosts need to be reconfigured or modified in anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said earlier this is only phase 1. &amp;nbsp;You will see in the diagram that we are still running our old ezmlm/qmail stack. This will now become the focus of phase 2, to determine what changes, if any best suit our projects and the foundation as a whole. One of the failings of the current system is that if the listserv host goes down, mail basically stops flowing, as this is the authoritative host for all apache addresses. We will also be looking very hard as to how we can run multiple listserv hosts to remove that single point of failure concern.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation relies on email as it's official internal communication mechanism, this is evident no more than when we say "If it didn't happen on the list, it didn't happen". Moving this service forward will be a significant challenge, one which we hope to deliver as soon as we can.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions please email &lt;a href="mailto:infrastructure@apache.org"&gt;infrastructure@apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and we will do what we can to help. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for this has been the desire to have a unified standard for publishing web site contents across all projects. The current workflow is handled by two components, svnpubsub - a pubsub service for subversion - and svnwcsub, the client for svnpubsub. In&amp;nbsp;2013 we added a similar method for Git, called gitpubsub. Nowadays, gitpubsub is used for a ton of different service messages in the ASF; Git commits, JIRA notifications, GitHub communication and so on, and as of today, we have added gitwcsub, a gitpubsub client similar to svnwcsub, &lt;b&gt;enabling projects to use git as their repository for web site content.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In order to use git as your web site repository, you must have your web site in a git repo. This can either be an existing repository or a new one created just for your web site. gitwcsub will, by default, pull content from the &lt;i&gt;asf-site&lt;/i&gt; branch of any repo set up for it, so all that needs to be done is to have this branch in a repo on &lt;a href="http://git-wip-us.apache.org"&gt;git-wip-us.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; and you can have your projects site published via git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have your site transferred to a git based workflow, please file a JIRA ticket with infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we want to thank the CouchDB project for being guinea pigs in this process!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The level of resources and jobs able to run is 'fair&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;use', which is fair indeed considering that is gratis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"/&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"/&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Of course, most GitHub organizations aren't as large as the Apache organization&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;on GitHub, and we recently discovered that the Foundation was one of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;largest gratis open source user of Travis CI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;On average, our build queue length was in excess of 300 jobs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;While we appreciate the generosity of the Travis-CI folks, our demand&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;for their services was clearly outstripping the available supply. This&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;also meant that a lot of Apache projects were frustrated, or even&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;abandoning their efforts to use Travis-CI because the length of time&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;for a build to start was high enough to not really quality as&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;'continuous'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"/&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"/&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;To that end, we've now purchased a subscription to Travis services,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;and have moved from 'fair use' to having 30 concurrent builds. This&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"&gt;should be a dramatic increase in throughput for Apache projects who make use of Travis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our service offerings, and to make it easier to interact with the Infrastructure team we are launching an instance of JIRA Service Desk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should make it much simpler to submit common JIRA issues, such as SVN-&amp;gt;GIT migration, New wiki, New JIRA project, etc. The forms ask for the minimum amount of data we would need to complete the request.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common theme we found that delayed resolution was needing additional information to action tickets. Service Desk allows us to request the exact information needed for a specific task.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to ask everyone to start using this to submit new issues. You can access this new service here: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://helpinfrahelpyou.apache.org"&gt;https://helpinfrahelpyou.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;or &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://infrahelp.apache.org"&gt;https://infrahelp.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these changes is to our infrastructure, and is a move from manually managed and maintained web servers towards re-deployable, configuration managed servers that tend to themselves and rarely, if ever, require manual intervention. As such, we have started moving towards no longer manually fixing bugs that creep up on various project web sites, in particular setting the correct permission on files. This means that all projects are now required to check their download scripts and verify that the executable flag is set on these CGI files. If not, your download page will likely not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we receive an email from a user of an Apache project about an error on a project web site, we will forward this to the respective project, but we ask that projects take proactive measures and check their download scripts (and any other scripts they may have) to ensure that they have the right permissions set and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Projects using the CMS system will, for the time being, have to commit the execute bit changes directly to the staging repo for their site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards,&lt;br/&gt;Daniel on behalf of the Infrastructure Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;It took us far too long to spin up replacement machine. This in fact took a few hours due to having to manually build the host from source media and encountering several BIOS/RaidController issues. &amp;nbsp;Our endeavour to have automated provisioning of tin (bare metal) would certainly have improved this time considerably had it been available at the time of the event. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Many machines pointing to eris.a.o for LDAP - not to a service name (such as ldap1-us-west for example) which meant we couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily restore LDAP services for some US hosts without making them also think SVN services had also moved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Assigning of issues in JIRA - It has perhaps been a long held understanding that if an issue is assigned to someone in JIRA then they are actively managing that issue. This event clearly shows how fragile that belief is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;DNS (geo) updates were problematic - Daniel will be posting a proposal on Thursday, which will outline our concerns around DNS and a viable way forward that meets our needs and is not reliant on us storing all the data in SVN to be able to effect changes to zones. (This proposal was not created as a tiger of this event, it has been worked on for a number of weeks now).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;architectural problems for availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;We couldn't promote svn-eu to master - data differences/corruption&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; color: #042eee; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #042eee;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6236"&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6236&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current monitoring setup was not sufficient in catching disk errors and correctly alerting infra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Daniel to investigate and evaluate multimaster service availability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Implement an extended SSL check that not only ensures the service is up, but also checks cert validity (expire, revocation status etc), and the certificate chain is valid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;De-couple DNS from SVN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;De-couple the SVN authz file from SVN directly. Also breser@ has suggested we use the authz validation tool available from the svn install we have on hades, &amp;nbsp;as part of the template-&amp;gt;active file generation process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Move the ASF status page (http://status.apache.org) outside of our main colos so folks can continue to see it in the event of an outage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Vendor provided hardware monitoring tools mandatory on all new hardware deployments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Broader audience for incidents and status reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;More aggressive host replacement before these issues arise&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things being considered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Mandatory use of SNMP for enhanced data gathering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Issue &amp;lsquo;nagging&amp;rsquo; - develop some thoughts and ideas around the concept of auto-transitioning un-modified JIRA issues after N hours of in activity and actively nag the group until an update is made. This for example is how Atlassian (and so many others) handle their issues. &amp;nbsp;For example if an end-user doesn&amp;rsquo;t update the issue within 5 days, it is automatically closed, if we don&amp;rsquo;t update an open issue within 6 hours for a critical issue then we get nagged about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Automatically create new JIRA issues (utilising above mentioned auto-transition) to notify of hardware issues (not just relying on hundreds of cron emails a day).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;"&gt;Again as part of a wider thinking of how we use issue tracking consider the concept that you only assign an issue to yourself if you are explicitly working on it at that moment, i.e it should not sit in the queue assigned to someone for &amp;gt; N hours and not receive any updates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that went well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal; font-family: Arial; font-kerning: none; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

The primary master machine that hosts the Apache Software Foundation's subversion repositories is currently undergoing some emergency maintenance due to disk errors.&lt;br/&gt;
We do not currently have an ETA on when this will be fixed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
In the meantime, there will be no access to commit to SVN.&lt;br/&gt;
The read-only mirror at &lt;a href="http://svn.eu.apache.org" target="_blank"&gt;svn.eu.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; is still working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: 18:30 UTC, 3 December 2014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine that hosts the SVN master suffered root filesystem corruption. This corruption led to a severe degradation of the SVN service, and to repair the issue the service was taken down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This filesystem is separate from the filesystem that hosts the SVN repositories. We expect no data loss from this issue. (And we have multiple copies of this data available to us.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be keeping this blog post updated with more details as they become available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE: 21:30 UTC, 3 December 2014&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've removed the master from DNS rotation, so read-only access remains accessible everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commits to SVN remain disabled while we work on restoring the service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE: 04:45 UTC, 4 December 2014&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The service remains offline while we work on moving the service to a new host. &amp;nbsp;During the work to resolve the failed disks on eris (the previous host) it became apparent that it would not be the best use of our time to keep working on this (and we had frankly lost faith in the disks).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now several hours into this move. &amp;nbsp;The data has been synchronised to the new host, and now we are working on porting the configuration of the old host into puppet and making it fit the new setup on which it will be run. &amp;nbsp;We don't currently have an exact time when we think it will be finished, but we are hopeful it will be during Thursday 4th December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to apologise the downtime, but we are taking actions that we feel are in the best interests of a key piece of foundation infrastructure. &amp;nbsp;As always you can come and find us in the Hipchat channel #asfinfra -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hipchat.com/gdAiIcNyE" title="https://www.hipchat.com/gdAiIcNyE"&gt;https://www.hipchat.com/gdAiIcNyE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;if you have any questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; --pctony&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE: 11:18 UTC, 4 December 2014&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We are performing sanity checks on the new puppetized configuration. For historical reasons, our svn system has relied on specially crafted versions of svn, which we are attempting to replace with canonical release versions instead, so as to easier set up a new host, should we experience another major outage. This entails a lot of rewriting of scripts, but we expect most of this to have been done now, pending a full system check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all this is done, we will be performing authorization checks to make sure everything is as it should be, and when satisfied, we will reopen the svn repo for committers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ETA is still uncertain, but remains a hopeful "today" (Thursday, December 4th). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--humbedooh &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE: 16:15 UTC, 4 December 2014&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are nearly there. We are currently putting the finishing touches to the config, and we will begin closed testing within the infrastructure group very soon. Assuming this goes well we will aim to open the service as soon as possible after this. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay will come when we ensure that no data could be lost as a result of re-starting the service. &amp;nbsp;Data security and provenance is our utmost concern.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More news to follow in the next couple of hours hopefully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--pctony&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE: 03:01 UTC, 5 December 2014 &amp;nbsp;[FINAL UPDATE]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. As of 5 minutes ago the main subversion service was restored. Only one repository is currently not available, the dist repository used by projects to stage dev and release outputs. This will be fixed ASAP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spot any issues with the service, in the first instance please hop onto HipChat and chat to us - &lt;a href="https://www.hipchat.com/gdAiIcNyE"&gt;https://www.hipchat.com/gdAiIcNyE&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Or you can use the usual email address &lt;a href="mailto:infrastructure@apache.org"&gt;infrastructure@apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; if you prefer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outage has forced us to review the setup of the primary subversion host and as a result of this we have made many changes to bring it inline with our current practice and standards. This involved re-engineering quite a lot of things that had accumulated over the years, and like many a good onion the more layers we peeled back the more we sobbed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to report that this host is now completely managed with puppet, and is delivering metrics to our instance of Circonus very happily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again thank you for your patience and we hope that the service feels a lot more sprightly on it's new host.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br/&gt;On behalf of the Apache Infrastructure Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--pctony&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months we have become increasingly aware of a slowing down of our MoinMoin wiki service. &amp;nbsp;We have attributed this, at least in part, due to the way MoinMoin stores some data about user accounts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across all of our wiki instances (in the farm) we had a little over 1.08 million distinct user accounts. &amp;nbsp;Many of which have never been used (spam etc). &amp;nbsp;So we have decided to archive all users who have not accessed any of the wiki sites they were registered for in more than 128 days. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has resulted in us being able to archive a little over 800k users. &amp;nbsp;This leaves us with around 200k users across 77 wikis. This still feels very high, and in the coming weeks we will investigate further still in how we can better understand if those remaining accounts are making valid changes, or are they just link farm home pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think your account was affected by this, and you would like to have your account restored, then please contact the Infra team using this page&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infra-contact"&gt;http://www.apache.org/dev/infra-contact&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;ASF Infra Team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This service is available to any Apache project to use to sign their releases. Traditionally, Apache projects have shipped source code. The code tarballs are signed with a GPG signature to allow users and providers to verify the code's authenticity, but users have either compiled their own applications or some projects have provided convenience binaries. With projects like Apache OpenOffice, users expect to receive binaries that are ready to run. Today's desktop and mobile operating systems expect that binaries will be signed by the vendor -- which had left a gap to be filled for Apache projects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a great deal of research, we have chosen Symantec's &lt;a href="http://www.symantec.com/code-signing/secure-app-service"&gt;Secure App Service&lt;/a&gt; offering to provide code signing service. This allows us to granularly permit access; and each PMC will have their own certificate(s) for signing. The per-project nature of certificate issuance allows us to revoke a signature without disrupting other projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This service will permit projects to sign artifacts either via a web GUI or a SOAP API. In addition a &lt;a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/code-signing/java-client/"&gt;Java client&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/buildutil/SignCode.java?view=log"&gt;ant task&lt;/a&gt; for signing have been written and a maven plugin is &lt;a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-infrastructure-dev/201409.mbox/%3C542181B4.4030104%40apache.org%3E"&gt;under development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This service results in a 'pay for what you use' scenario, so PMCs are asked to use the service responsibly. To that end, projects will have access to a test environment to ensure that they have their process working correctly before consuming actual credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, we've had two projects who have helped testing this and working out process for which we are very grateful. Those projects, Commons and Tomcat, have successfully released signed artifacts recently. (Commons Daemon 1.0.15 and Tomcat 8.0.14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects that wish to use this service should &lt;a href="https://reference.apache.org/pmc/newcodesigning"&gt;open an Infra JIRA ticket&lt;/a&gt; under the Codesigning component. Further &lt;a href="https://reference.apache.org/pmc/codesigning"&gt;information for projects using the service&lt;/a&gt; is also maintained by the infra team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We've set up the necessary hooks on all github.com/apache repositories that are up as of Wednesday, Oct 1, 2014, and will be adding the hooks to all new repositories going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to do to set it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Create a new job, probably copied from an existing job.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not doing any &amp;ldquo;mvn deploy&amp;rdquo; or equivalent in the new job - this job shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be deploying any artifacts to Nexus, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Check the "Enable Git validated merge support&amp;rdquo; box - you can leave the first few fields set to their default, since we&amp;rsquo;re not actually pushing anything. This is just required to get the pull request builder to register correctly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;Set the &amp;ldquo;GitHub project&amp;rdquo; field to the HTTP URL for your repository - i.e.,"http://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;- make sure it ends with that trailing slash and doesn&amp;rsquo;t include .git, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the Git SCM section of the job configuration, set the repository URL to point to the GitHub git:// URL for your repository - i.e.,&amp;nbsp;git://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn.git.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;You should be able to leave the &amp;ldquo;Branches to build&amp;rdquo; field as is - this won&amp;rsquo;t be relevant anyway.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Click the &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; button in &amp;ldquo;Additional Behaviors&amp;rdquo; and choose "Strategy for choosing what to build&amp;rdquo;. Make sure the choosing strategy is set to &amp;ldquo;Build commits submitted for validated merge&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Uncheck any existing build triggers - this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be running on a schedule, polling, running when SNAPSHOT dependencies are built, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Check the &amp;ldquo;Build pull requests to the repository&amp;rdquo; option in the build triggers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Optionally change anything else in the job that you&amp;rsquo;d like to be different for a pull request build than for a normal build - i.e., any downstream build triggers should probably be removed, &amp;nbsp;you may want to change email recipients, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Save, and you&amp;rsquo;re done!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;Now when a pull request is opened or new changes are pushed to an existing pull request to your repository, this job will be triggered, and it will build the pull request. A link will be added to the pull request in the list of builds for the job, and when the build completes, Jenkins will comment on the pull request with the build result and a link to the build at &lt;a href="https://builds.apache.org"&gt;builds.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In addition, you can also use the "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub" option in the build triggers for non-pull request jobs, instead of polling - Jenkins receives notifications from GitHub whenever one of our repositories has been pushed to. Jenkins can then determine which jobs use that repository and the branch that was pushed to, and trigger the appropriate build.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;span style="font-stretch: normal;"&gt;If you have any questions or problems, please email builds@apache.org or open a BUILDS JIRA at &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BUILDS/"&gt;issues.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

These methodologies check that incoming email actually originated via a valid mail server for the senders domain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example if you send from myuserid@apache.org, but you just send that via your ISP at home, it could be construed as being junk as it never came via an apache.org mail server. &amp;nbsp;Some time ago we setup a service on people.apache.org to cater for this, but it was never enforced and it seems that the SMTP daemon running the service is not 100% RFC compliant and thus some people have been unable to use this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, we have stood up a new service on host mail-relay.apache.org that will allow committers to send their apache.org emails via a daemon that is RFC compliant and uses your LDAP credentials. You can read here [2] what settings you will need to be able to use this service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday October 10th, at 13:00 UTC the old service on people.apache.org will be terminated, and the updates to the DNS to enforce sending of all apache.org email to have originated via an ASF mail server will be enabled. This means that as of this time if you do not send your apache.org email via mail-relay it is very likely that the mail will not reach it's destination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say 'send your apache.org email' &amp;nbsp;- we mean that when you send *&lt;b&gt;from&lt;/b&gt;* your userid@apache.org email. &amp;nbsp; Emails sent *&lt;b&gt;to&lt;/b&gt;* any apache.org email address will not affected by this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

So far, nothing unusual &lt;br/&gt;about that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, more issues reported on IRC/HipChat, and more issues opened.&lt;br/&gt;(INFRA-8326,INFRA-8327,INFRA-8328, INFRA-8334). By then it was obvious this more than &lt;br/&gt;a coincidence and it was already being looked into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twitter notifications and emails were sent out declaring the degraded performance an outage &lt;br/&gt;and On Call was full time looking into the issue. Others joined the call to assist and eventually &lt;br/&gt;the outage was determined to be a change to LDAP configuration made 2 days ago by Infra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(See infra:r921805 for the revert of that.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LDAP change was made to improve response times as it was being reported as being slow&lt;br/&gt;to return queries. Reverting the change cured the issues Nexus was having contacting the &lt;br/&gt;groups that committers belonged to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be another avenue looked into for improving LDAP query response times whilst not &lt;br/&gt;affecting those services that connect via anon bind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infra thanks everyone for their patience whilst this was looked into and resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks go to those involved in working towards the solution:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gavin McDonald (gmcdonald) &lt;br/&gt;Tony Stevenson (pctony)&lt;br/&gt;Chris Lambertus (cml)&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Gruno (humbedooh)&lt;br/&gt;Brian Fox (brianf)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gav&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While this has been improved dramatically by the increase in workers generously provided by Yahoo! on physical hosts, we're always trying to look forward and be prepared for increased usage in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To that end, we've set up worker images on Rackspace, generated using the fantastic tool &lt;a href="http://packer.io" target="_blank"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href="http://jclouds.apache.org"&gt;Apache jclouds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JClouds+Plugin"&gt;plugin for Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, Ubuntu workers will be spun up dynamically on Rackspace using those images when there's a queue of pending builds that are able to run on the &amp;ldquo;ubuntu&amp;rdquo; label. Up to five of these workers can be running at a time, and they're automatically removed from Jenkins and destroyed on Rackspace once they've been idle a set period of time. This burst capacity will help us prevent a long wait for builds to run on &lt;a href="http://builds.apache.org"&gt;builds.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We're able to do this thanks to Rackspace generously donating resources to the Apache Software Foundation. We're extremely grateful for this, and if any other public cloud providers are also interested in donating compute cycles to the Foundation, please contact the Infrastructure team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One thing to note - the worker image we're using is still new and may have bugs in it. If you see your build suddenly failing for mysterious reasons, please take a look at the worker it ran on - if it's a worker named something like &amp;ldquo;jenkins-ubuntu-1404-4gb-abc&amp;rdquo;, please open a BUILDS JIRA at &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org"&gt;issues.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; with a link to the failing build and we'll investigate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We've got more improvements for &lt;a href="http://builds.apache.org"&gt;builds.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; planned for the future, and we're looking forward to sharing them with all of you - there'll be a talk at ApacheCon EU this November on the current status of Jenkins at the ASF, what we've done to stabilize and improve the developer experience on &lt;a href="http://builds.apache.org"&gt;builds.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;this year, and what's planned for the future - hope to see you there!&lt;/div&gt;

To care for the infrastructure that the ASF depends on, the foundation has hired several contractors to supplement the dedicated cadre of volunteers who help maintain the ASFs hardware and services. To best utilize the time of our paid contractors and volunteers, the Infrastructure team will be adopting an on-call rotation to meet requests and resolve outages in a timely fashion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why We're Establishing an On-Call Rotation
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In groups, especially groups that are charged with overlapping duties, there's occasionally a sense of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank"&gt;diffusion of responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. There tends to be a good number of tasks or incidents that routinely occur that need a clear owner. We've also tried to set expectations around our service levels relative to the importance of a service. In example, a new mailing list can be set up as convenient, but a failing mail service needs to be addressed immediately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical side of this has been that we have historically alerted via email and/or SMS about any urgent issues that came up. Of course those alerts went to everyone on the team. If the alert occurs at an inconvenient time, either everyone responds, which is likely wasteful, or no one responds thinking someone else will.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Infrastructure team's face to face meeting in July we decided we'd adopt an on-call rotation for the contractors so that everyone wasn't responsible for everything all of the time.  We then went looking for something to let us sanely (and without building it ourselves) deal with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up choosing &lt;a href="https://pagerduty.com" target="_blank"&gt;PagerDuty&lt;/a&gt;, which has a number of ways of receiving alerts. More importantly, it allows us to set a schedule, easily override it for holidays or illnesses, and do so programmatically. It also seamlessly integrates with &lt;a href="https://hipchat.com"&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt;, which Infrastructure is running a trial of and communicates with our mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PagerDuty also supports a clear escalation path that begins alerting other people about issues if the person on-call fails to respond in a timely manner. Additionally, PagerDuty's mobile apps are built with &lt;a href="https://cordova.apache.org"&gt;Apache Cordova&lt;/a&gt;, which is an interesting circle. We've finished our trial and decided to adopt PagerDuty. PagerDuty&amp;nbsp;was especially gracious and made our account gratis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting an on-call rotation will allow us to provide a better service and response time, while also clearly setting expectations around contractor availability so they can relax on their off weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we'd like to remind you of the SSL-enabled SMTP submission service we offer committers listening on people.apache.org port 465. &amp;nbsp;Gmail users in particular can enjoy a convenient way of sending email, to any recipient even outside apache.org, using their apache.org committer address. &amp;nbsp;For more on that please see our website's &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/user-email.html#via-smtp-based-mail-submission-service-recommended"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complement these features we'd also like to remind committers of the ability to request an "owner file" be added to their email forwarder by filing an appropriate INFRA jira ticket. &amp;nbsp;Owner files alleviate most of the problems associated with outside organizations, who may be running strict SPF policies, attempting to reach you at your apache.org address. &amp;nbsp;Without an owner file those messages will typically bounce back to those organizations instead of successfully reaching you at your target forwarding address. &amp;nbsp;For those familiar with SRS, this is a poor-man's version of that specification's feature set. &amp;nbsp;Please direct your detailed questions about owner files to the infrastructure-dev@apache.org mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: we've extended this bypass feature to include any committer email addresses listed in their personal LDAP record with Apache.&lt;/p&gt;

**Note**: The solution described below has been incorporated into ezmlm. However, it creates a new problem, generating double 'Reply-To:' headers in the case of lists with a `reply-to` set to something other than the list name. A complete rewrite of this function is under consideration. You can follow the discussion on Jira ticket &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-24849" target="_blank"&gt;INFRA-24849&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Yahoo! switched their DMARC policy in mid-April, we've seen an increase in undeliverable messages sent from our mail server for Yahoo! accounts subscribed to our lists. &amp;nbsp; Roughly half of Apache's mailing lists do some form of message munging, whether it be Subject header prefixes, appended message trailers, or removed mime components. &amp;nbsp;Such actions are incompatible with Y!'s policy for its users, which has meant more bounces and more frustration trying to maintain inclusive discussions with Y! users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Y!'s actions are likely just the beginning of a trend towards strong DMARC policies aimed at eliminating forged emails, we've taken the extraordinary step of munging Y! user's From headers to append a spec-compliant .INVALID marker on their address, and dropping the DKIM-Signature: header for such messages. &amp;nbsp;We are an ezmlm shop and maintain a heavily customized .ezmlmrc file, so carrying this action out was relatively straightforward with a 30-line perl header filter prepended to certain lines in the "editor" block of our .ezmlmrc file. &amp;nbsp;The filter does a dynamic lookup of DMARC "p=reject" policies to inform its actions, so we are prepared for future adopters beyond the early ones like Yahoo!, AOL, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. &amp;nbsp; Interested parties in our solution may visit &lt;a href="http://www.sunstarsys.com/essays/mailing-lists"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for details and the Apache-licensed code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this filter only applies to half our lists- the remainder that do no munging are perfectly compatible with DMARC rejection policies without modification of our list software or configuration. &amp;nbsp;Apache projects that prefer to avoid munging may file a Jira ticket with infrastructure to ask that their lists be set to "ezmlm-make -+ -TXF" options.&lt;/p&gt;

Initial efforts at remediation seemed to clear this up but on the morning of May 7th the problem worsened and we proactively disabled mail service to deal with the failure. This outage affected all ASF mailing lists and mail forwarding.

Two of these are external facing mail exchangers that receive mail. The final server handles mailing list expansion, alias forwarding and mail delivery in general. That latter server had two volumes that experienced a disk outage each. This degraded performance substantially and led to the mail delays seen on May 6th and 7th. The service was proactively disabled on May 7th in an attempt to let the arrays rebuild without the significant disk I/O overhead caused by processing the large mail backlog. Ultimately multiple attempts to rebuild the underlying arrays failed and eventually other drives in the array where the data volume was stored failed rendering recovery a hopeless task on May 8th. We began working to restore backups from our offsite backup location to our primary US datacenter. When this began to take longer than expected, additional concurrent efforts began to restore service in one of our secondary datacenters as well as in a public cloud instance. Ultimately we ended up completing the restoration to our primary US datacenter first and were able to bring the service online. When the service resumed, we had an estimated 10 million message backlog in addition to our normal 1.7-2 million ongoing daily message flow. The amount of backlogged mail taxed the existing infrastructure and architecture of the mail service and took almost 5 days to completely clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"/&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; color: #222222; font-family: arial;"&gt;Improve the monitoring of the mail service itself as well as the hardware.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; color: #222222; font-family: arial;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; color: #222222; font-family: arial;"&gt;Insure we have adequate spares on hand for the majority of our core services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; color: #222222; font-family: arial;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; color: #222222; font-family: arial;"&gt;Place our mail server under configuration management to reduce our MTTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small; color: #222222; font-family: arial;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"/&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"&gt;Medium-to-Long term initiatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"/&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"&gt;More fully deploy our config management and automated provisioning across our infrastructure so MTTR is reduced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new monitoring system is sponsored by circonus and most of the monitoring as well as the central database runs on &lt;a href="www.circonus.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.circonus.com&lt;/a&gt;. The infrastructure team have built and deployed logic around the standard circonus system:&lt;br/&gt;
- A private broker, to monitor internal services&amp;nbsp; without exposing them on internet&lt;br/&gt; - A dedicated broker (inhouse development) that monitor special ASF systems (like svn compare US - EU)&lt;br/&gt;
- A configuration system, that are based on svn.&lt;br/&gt;
- A new status page &lt;a href="status.apache.org" target="_blank"&gt;status.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
- A new team structure (all committers with sudo karma on a VM, get an email when something happens with the VM)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system is a lot faster and we can therefore offer projects monitoring of project URLs, of course the project also need to have a team that handles the alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version has approx. the same facilities as Nagios, but we are planning (and actively programming) a version.2 that will allow us to better predict problems before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the upcoming features are:&lt;br/&gt;
- disk monitoring&lt;br/&gt;
- vital data statistic from core system (like size of mail queues)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change of monitoring system is a vital component in our transition to automate services and thereby enable infra to more effectively secure the stability of the infrastructure as well as make early detection of potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was presented in Apachecon denver 2014, slides can be found&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://people.apache.org/~jani/circonus.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to present the live version at apachecon budapest 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

Initial efforts at remediation seemed to clear this up but on the morning of May 7th the problem worsened and we proactively disabled mail service to deal with the failure. The underlying hardware suffered failures on multiple disks. This outage effects all ASF mailing lists and mail forwarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This service is housed at &lt;a href="http://osuosl.org"&gt;OSUOSL&lt;/a&gt;, and we are currently waiting on smart hands to help with replacing hardware. Our expectation at this point is that we still have multiple hours worth of outage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Incoming mail is currently being received and held in queue by our mail exchangers. We also have a copy of the existing queue that hasn't been processed; so we expect no mail or data loss. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASF Infra's twitter bot will provide updates as we have them for the duration of the outage. Feel free to follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/infrabot"&gt;@infrabot&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Twitter. There will be an update on this post as well as the situation progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE 7 May 19:27 UTC &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;- Drives have been replaced, array is attempting to rebuild. As indicated earlier on twitter, there likely remains hours of outage. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE 7 May 20:44 UTC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - The disk array is still in the process of repairing. Several hundred mails were processed during a reboot, but more work remains before service is restored. &amp;nbsp;Mail service has been disabled again as the array repair process is CPU-bound. The plan going forward is to allow the disk arrays to finish repairs. Once that is complete, we'll reenable the mail service and flush what is currently in the queue. Finally, once the queue is empty we'll begin receiving mail again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE 8 May 05:00 UTC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - The disk array failed to repair itself. The disks have been replaced and a new installation has been completed. Progress continues to be made towards resolution, but nothing firm enough yet for us to predict an time for restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 8 May 15:45 UTC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; - No material change of status has occurred. Infra worked in shifts around the clock last night and continue to do so to restore service. More updates as they become available. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 9 May 11:20 UTC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; - We are working on temporarily restoring the most essential email aliases. In the meantime, inquiries may be made to &lt;a href="mailto:infrastructure@apache.pw"&gt;infrastructure@apache.pw&lt;/a&gt; or on our IRC channel, #asfinfra on Freenode. The work on restoring the service in full is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE 9 May 17:20 UTC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - We've successfully restored a host from backups and will be starting testing soon. Based on the progress made in those tests we'll try and provide expectations around restoration of service timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE 10 May 15:45 UTC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - We've started pushing live mails through the system - you'll begin to see them trickle in as we gradually open the floodgates to restore service. Expect intermittent spurts for a while.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 10 May 21:55 UTC&lt;/b&gt; - &amp;nbsp;The floodgates have been opened. &amp;nbsp;As we have a significant amount of backlog to catch up on, please be patient as the service does this. &amp;nbsp;As always feel free to contact us if you have any questions. In the immediate short term (next day or so, we suggest you continue to use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="mailto:infrastructure@apache.pw"&gt;infrastructure@apache.pw&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and our IRC channel, #asfinfra on Freenode. &amp;nbsp;We would like to thank you for your patience during this extremely busy time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;UPDATE 12 May 16:04 UTC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Clarification - we have opened the floodgates, but have a substantial amount of backlog; and with the sudden rush of mail are being throttled by various mail services. With the addition of mail that's coming through anyway; it may take us from 2-5 days to fully flush the backlog. This time is so wide because of a wide variety of factors that are largely outside of our control, such as new mail coming in and mail services individual throttling policies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we've learned about the heartbleed incident is that it is hard, in the sense of perhaps only viable to a well-funded blackhat operation, to steal a private certificate and key from a vulnerable service. &amp;nbsp;Nevertheless, the central role Apache projects play in the modern software development world require us to mitigate against that circumstance. &amp;nbsp;Given the length of time and exposure window for this bug's existence, we have to assume that some/many Apache passwords may have been compromised, and perhaps even our private wildcard cert and key, so we've taken a few steps as of today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fixed the vulnerability in our openssl installations to prevent further damage,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've acquired a new wildcard cert for apache.org that we have rolled out prior to this blog entry,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will require that all committers rotate their LDAP passwords (committers visit &lt;a href="https://id.apache.org/reset/enter"&gt;id.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; to reset LDAP passwords once they've been forcibly reset),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are encouraging all service administrators to all non-LDAP service like jira to rotate those passwords as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the cert change for svn users- we'd also like to suggest that you remove your existing apache.org certs from your .subversion cache to prevent potential MITM attacks using the old cert. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately it is relatively painless to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;% grep -l apache.org ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/* | xargs rm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: our openoffice wildcard cert was never vulnerable to this issue as it was served from an openssl-1.0.0 host.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original focus of the CMS was to provide the tools necessary for handling &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;http://www.apache.org/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and similar Anakia-based sites. &amp;nbsp;The scope quickly changed when &lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"&gt;Apache OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; was accepted into the incubator... handling over 9GB of content well was quite an undertaking and will be soon discussed at Apachecon in Denver during &lt;a href="http://apacheconnorthamerica2014.sched.org/event/041f72d553e8414e68180854cc62dc68#.UzHCItzoaRs"&gt;Dave Fisher's talk&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;From there the build system was extended to allow builds using multiple technologies and programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that time in late 2012 the CMS codebase has sat still, but recently we've upped the ante and decided to offer features aimed at parity with other site building technologies like jekyll, nanoc and middleman. &amp;nbsp;You can see some of the new additions to the Apache CMS in action at &lt;a href="http://thrift.apache.org/"&gt;http://thrift.apache.org/&lt;/a&gt;. The Apache Thrift website was originally written to use nanoc before being ported to the newly improved Apache CMS. They kept the YAML headers for their markdown pages and converted from a custom preprocessing script used for inserting code snippets to using a fully-supported snippet-fetching feature in the Apache CMS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The new improvements to the Apache CMS allowed us to quickly standardize the build process and guarantee repeatable results as well as integrate direct code snippets into the website from our source repository."&lt;br/&gt;- Jake Farrell, Apache Thrift PMC Chair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the Apache Thrift website&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/thrift/cms-site/trunk/"&gt;cms sources&lt;/a&gt; for sample uses of the new features found in &lt;a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/cms/build/lib/ASF/View.pm"&gt;ASF::View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/cms/build/lib/ASF/Value/Snippet.pm"&gt;ASF::Value::Snippet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new features mean a much higher level of replication and retention of what goes on on GitHub, which in turns both help projects maintain control over what goes on within their project, as well as keeping a record of everything that's happening in the development of a project, whether it be on ASF hardware or off-site on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, these new features allows for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any Pull Request that gets opened, closed, reopened or commented on now gets recorded on the project's mailing list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a project has a JIRA instance, any PRs or comments on PRs that include a JIRA ticket ID will trigger an update on that specific ticket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replying to a GitHub comment on the dev@ mailing list will trigger a comment being placed on GitHub (yes, it works both ways!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub activity can now be relayed to IRC channels on the Freenode network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most of our things, this is an opt-in feature. If you are in a project that would like to take advantage of these new features, please contact infrastructure, preferably by filing a &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA" target="_blank" title="JIRA"&gt;JIRA ticket&lt;/a&gt; with the component set to Git, and specifying which of the new features you would like to see enabled for your project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Infrastructure Team, I hope you will find these new features useful and be mindful in your use of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why yet another paste bin, you ask?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, this site is different in that is it run by the ASF, for the ASF, in that we fully control what happens to your data when you post it, or perhaps more important, what does NOT happen to it. The site enforces a "from committers to everyone" policy, meaning only &lt;u&gt;committers&lt;/u&gt; may post new data on the site, but everyone is invited to watch the result. While this is not a blanket guarantee that the data is accurate or true, it is nonetheless a guarantee that &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;what you see is data posted by an Apache committer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, committers have the option to post something as being "committers only", meaning only committers within the ASF can see the paste. This is much like the "private" pastes offered by many other sites, but with the added benefit that it prevents anyone snooping around from watching whatever you paste, unless they are actually a committer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Great, so how does it work?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It works like most other paste sites, in that you go to &lt;a href="http://paste.apache.org"&gt;http://paste.apache.org,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; paste your data, select which type of highlighting to use, and you get an URL with your paste. For text-only clients, raw data will be displayed, while regular browsers will enjoy a full web page with the ability to download or edit a paste. Currently we have support for httpd configurations, C/C++, Java, Lua, Erlang, XML/HTML, PHP, Shell scripts, Diff/Patch, Python and Perl syntax highlighting. If you want to have any other type of highlighting added, don't hesitate to ask!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this site enforces the "from committers to everyone" policy, you are required to use your LDAP credentials when making a paste. To allow for the use of the service within console applications (shells etc) that might not (or should not) provide authentication credentials (on public machines you'd want to avoid storing your committer credentials for instance!), we have equipped the site with a token generator, that both allows you to pipe any output you may have directly to the site as well as gives you some hints on how you may achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a directory listing that you'd only want your fellow committers to see. Publishing this, using the token system, is as easy as doing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #b5ffb4;"&gt;$&amp;gt; ls -la | privpaste&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;http://paste.apache.org/p/1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, the command returns a URL ready for sharing with your fellow committers. Had you wanted for everyone to be able to see it, you could have used the &lt;i&gt;pubpaste&lt;/i&gt; alias instead (click on "generate token" on the site to get more information about tokens and the useful aliases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We hope you'll enjoy this new service, and use it wisely as well as often. Should you have any questions or suggestions, we'd be most happy to receive them through any infra channel you want to use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new features have recently been added to the CMS, courtesy of David Blevins.&amp;nbsp; These features are geared towards streamlining the user experience for &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref#non-committer"&gt;anonymous users&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The first feature is "Quick Mail", which is the analog of "Quick Commit" but for anonymous users who cannot otherwise commit their changes directly.&amp;nbsp; Quick Mail, which is enabled by default, will take the immediate submission of an anonymous Edit session and post it directly to the project's dev list, saving several steps that might be hard for a new user to walk through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second feature is a natural result of that known as anonymous clones.&amp;nbsp; In the subsequent mailout from "Quick Mail", there will be an url for committers to use to effectively clone the working copy of the anonymous user who generated the patch.&amp;nbsp; This makes review and subsequent commit operations much more convenient than directly applying the emailed patch to a local working copy.&amp;nbsp; In fact it is possible for users to clone a non-anonymous user's working copy, so anyone experiencing chronic problems with their working copy on the CMS can get help from other committers by simply using the "Mail Diff" feature to contact either the dev list or another apache committer with details of their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have added these features in the hopes this will considerably lower the bar for anonymous users in particular to take advantage of the CMS.&amp;nbsp; Please let your community know about them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty good right?&amp;nbsp; Any questionable characters are removed from $artifact before exposing it to the shell via backticks... hmm, well turns out that's not so easy to determine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first warning sign that was given to the author of this script was that he hadn't enabled taint checks- if he had this is how things probably would have looked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -T
&lt;p&gt;use strict;
use warnings;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
my $artifact = "/apache-tomee/1.0.1-SNAPSHOT/";
$artifact = $ENV{PATH_INFO} if $ENV{PATH_INFO};&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$artifact = "/$artifact/";
$artifact =~ s,/+,/,g;
$artifact =~ m,^([a-zA-Z.[0-9]-]*)$, or die "Detainting regexp failed!";
$artifact = $1;
$artifact =~ s,../,,g;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my $content = &lt;code&gt;wget -q -O - http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/org/apache/openejb$artifact&lt;/code&gt;;
... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which doesn't look like much of a change, but the impact on the actual logic is massive: we've gone from a substitution that strips unwanted chars to a fully-anchored pattern that matches only a string full of wanted chars only, and dies on pattern match failure.&amp;nbsp; Sadly the developer in question did not heed this early advice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there is a bug (well several) in the core pattern that renders the original substitution ineffective.&amp;nbsp; However the impact on the taint-checked version causes the detainting match to fail and renders the script harmless!&amp;nbsp; The practical difference is that instead of a script with a working remote shell exploit, we have script that serves no useful purpose.&amp;nbsp; To the Apache sysadmins this is a superior outcome, even though to the developer the original, essentially working script is preferable- worlds are colliding here, but guess who wins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ASF the sysadmins almost invariably refuse to run perl or ruby CGI scripts without taint-checking enabled, and will always prefer CGI scripts be written in languages that support taint checks as they tend to enforce good practice in dealing with untrusted input.&amp;nbsp; This example, which is in fact one of the first times we've even considered allowing Apache devs to deploy non-download CGI scripts on the &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org"&gt;www.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; server, serves as a useful reminder to Apache devs as to why using languages that support taint checks is an essential component of scripting on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The httpd logs of several ASF services are aggregated and archived on minotaur.apache.org.&amp;nbsp; Minotaur is also people.apache.org, the shell host for committers, and committers were encouraged to analyse the logs and &lt;a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201205.mbox/%3CCABD8fLV30-YaFaYt21GuCJX+_xqqPCB+S+XpW_G1aydyTrgkug@mail.gmail.com%3E"&gt;produce aggregated data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, for two services, the archived logs included &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_forensic.html"&gt;forensic logs&lt;/a&gt;, which are extra-verbose logs that include all HTTP request headers.&amp;nbsp; (The logs are never encrypted, even if the HTTP connection was wrapped by SSL encryption.)&amp;nbsp; Both of these services  &lt;a href="http://s.apache.org/"&gt;http://s.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://svn.apache.org/"&gt;http://svn.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;  allow anyone to use them in a read-only manner anonymously, and allow further operations (such as creating shortlinks) to LDAP-authenticated committers.&amp;nbsp; Authentication is usually done by embedding the username and password, encoded in base64, in the "Authorization:" HTTP header, under SSL encryption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Base64 is a reversible transform.&amp;nbsp; (It is an encoding, not a cipher.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, any Apache committer could learn the passwords of any other committer by reading the log files and reversing the base64 encoding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shutting the barn door&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logs archive directory was made readable by the root user only.&amp;nbsp; Forensic logging was disabled, and past forensic logs deleted.&amp;nbsp; ZFS snapshots containing those logs were destroyed, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding the horse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that several committers had on one occasion or another copied the logs in order to analyse them, so we operated on the assumption that copies of the sensitive forensic logs were circulating on hardware we do not control.&amp;nbsp; We therefore opted to have all passwords changed, or reset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several Apache committers whose passwords grant very high access were advised privately to change their passwords.&amp;nbsp; The root@ team ensured the follow-through and, before announcing the vulnerability any further, changed the passwords of those whom had not done so themselves.&amp;nbsp; The root@ team also changed the passwords of all non-human (role) accounts on those services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vulnerability was then announced to all Apache committers with the same instructions: 'Your passwords may be compromised; change them "now"; we will explain the problem later.'.&amp;nbsp; This notice was authenticated via a PGP signature and via acknowledging it in a root-owned file on people.apache.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, passwords that have not been changed after forensic logs had been disabled  and, therefore, were presumed to be contained in compromised forensic logs  were changed by the root@ team to random strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were some committer to have compromised another Apache account using this vulnerability prior to these steps being taken, note that root access to all apache.org hosts is only available using one-time-passwords (otp) for certain privileged sudo users.&amp;nbsp; Such account holders have been instructed not to use the same password for otp as for LDAP, so this would not have resulted in an attacker gaining root privileges without our knowledge.&amp;nbsp; All of our commit activity is peer-reviewed and logged to various commit lists, and no reports of unusual commit activity have been received during the time frame in which this exposure was effective.&amp;nbsp; In fact no unusual activity has ever been reported regarding any of our LDAP-based services, so there is no reason for us to suspect malicious activity has occurred as a result of this vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preventing recurrence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No code changes were needed to the software that s.apache.org and
svn.apache.org run; the software was behaving correctly according to
its configuration, but the configuration itself  and the in-house
log archiving scripts  were incorrect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A member of the infrastructure team will be approaching the Apache HTTPD PMC with a documentation patch for mod_log_forensic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no malicious parties involved here (to our knowledge); we just made a configuration error.&amp;nbsp; The nature of the error meant we had to assume all passwords were compromised, and that was costly to fix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope our disclosure has been as open as possible and true to the ASF spirit.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully others can learn from our mistakes.&amp;nbsp; See our &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/info/20010519-hack.html"&gt;prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache_org_downtime_report"&gt;incident&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache_org_04_09_2010"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from the Apache Infrastructure Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Committers  please address questions to root@apache.org only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queries from the press should be sent to press@apache.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we've been working with the maven team to facilitate migration of &lt;a href="http://maven.apache.org"&gt;maven.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; to the Apache CMS, using maven as the core build system instead of the standard perl build scripts.&amp;nbsp; A mockup has been created at &lt;a href="http://maventest.apache.org/"&gt;maventest.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; to see how this will work.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Once the site is completed, there will be roughly 5GB of data to service, spanning dozens of maven components.&amp;nbsp; Each component will be self-contained and managed externally from the CMS site using a local maven svnpubsub plugin written mainly by Benson Margulies.&amp;nbsp; The CMS will glue all the components together into a single common site using the &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref#generated-docs"&gt;extpaths.txt&lt;/a&gt; file to configure the paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doxia subproject requires special treatment as an independent CMS subproject which is also using maven as it's core build system.&amp;nbsp; Special logic was introduced into the CMS to properly redirect subproject links based on maven source tree layouts, and the system has worked seamlessly so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent news includes the migration of the main &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/"&gt;incubator.apache.or&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt; site to the CMS.&amp;nbsp; There the CMS relies on Ant/Anakia to produce site builds instead of the standard perl build scripts, providing an easy migration path for folks accustomed to the old way of building the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially we've made good on the promise that the CMS is simply CI for websites with an easy way of editing pages within your browser.&amp;nbsp; Support for forrest builds is planned but hasn't been fleshed out with any live examples to date.&amp;nbsp; That would round out the major java site-building technologies currently deployed by Apache projects- volunteers welcome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cms"&gt;Apache CMS&lt;/a&gt; has seen lots of new improvements, all under the general theme of making the system more performant.&amp;nbsp; Supporting very large sites like the &lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"&gt;Apache OpenOffice User Site&lt;/a&gt; with almost 10 GB of content has presented new challenges, met largely with the introduction of zfs clones for generating per-user server-side working copies, changing what was an O(N) rsync job to an O(1) operation.&amp;nbsp; We've also moved the update processing out-of-band to further cut down on the time it takes for the bookmarklet to produce a page, eliminating all O(N) algorithms from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;More recent work focuses on the merge-based publication process, which for large changesets took a considerable amount of time to process.&amp;nbsp; That too has been recoded based on svnmucc and is now another O(1) operation- essentially a perfect copy of staging with a few adjustments for "external" paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine that with the activity around parallelizing the build system and you have a completely different performance profile compared to the way the system worked in 2011.&amp;nbsp; In short, if you haven't tried the CMS lately, and were a bit offput by the page rendering times or build speeds, have another look! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: describing the work done around external build support, focusing first on maven based sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Historically we have allowed users to choose how to handle their apache.org email.  However we will be making the following changes:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making LDAP authoritative for all mail forwarding addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will no longer be allowed to store their apache.org email locally on people.apache.org (minotaur)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Infra team will take the mail address currently held in either your .qmail or .forward file (.qmail is authoritative if they both exist) and inject this into LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will no longer allow users to configure mail filtering, but you can configure your SpamAssassin threshold as per &lt;a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/controlling_your_spamassassin_threshold1"&gt; our recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will make committers ~/.forward and ~/.qmail files read-only, there will still be at least one of these files, but it will be owned by the mail daemon user.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that all committers will be required to forward their apache.org email to an email address outside of the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing this to simplify the email infrastructure, and to help reduce the current level of complexity of maintaining people.apache.org.  Also, making LDAP authoritative means we can move some of the work straight out to the MXs, and thus avoid sending it through several mail servers.  In the new architecture if someone emails you directly at your apache.org mail address it will only be handled by one apache.org MX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we won't delete any email you currently have on people.apache.org.  Should you want to edit your LDAP record you should use &lt;a href="https://id.apache.org"&gt;https://id.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

The Infrastructure Team has just enabled a new feature to control your SpamAssassin Threshold for your apache.org account.  The default score for user delivery has always remained at 10, but with this new feature you can lower that score to anything you want. Many people with older accounts will probably prefer a lower score, like 5, which is the default for all apache mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower your score login to &lt;a href="https://id.apache.org/"&gt;id.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; and change your 'SpamAssassin Threshold (asf-sascore)' attribute to your desired level.  Don't forget to supply the form with your LDAP password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The ability to change their LDAP password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The ability to update your LDAP record, i.e. change forename, surname or mail attributes. [1].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users should note that this service will only allow you to manage your LDAP password,  thus controlling access to those resources currently protected by LDAP authnz.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
Once logged in you will note that some fields are not editable, this is by design and are there merely to show you your LDAP entry.  You are currently only allowed to edit your Surname, Given name (Forename), and Mail attributes.  This list may be extended as we make more features available, and they will be announced as and when.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of this service should note that we have a few small bugs to iron out, and this will be done as soon as possible.  For example if you attempt to modify your details and do no re-enter your password you will currently see a generic HTTP 500 error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks must go to Ian Boston (ieb), and Daniel Shahaf (danielsh) for making this work.  Ian provided the initial code (his first ever attempt at Python too). Daniel then took it and implemented several changes and generally improved the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  - It should be noted that updating your mail record in LDAP will not currently have any affect on where your apache.org email is forwarded on too.  This is planned to take place later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the past 3 months, the Infrastructure Team has developed and deployed a custom CMS for Apache projects to use to manage their websites.  There is a  &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cms.html"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; available which explains the rationale, role, and future plans for the CMS.  We have opened up the ACLs for the &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;www.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; site for all committers to now be able to edit content on the site using the cms (while still restricting live publication to the Apache membership and the Infrastructure Team).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basic workflow for committers is easy to describe:  first install the &lt;a href="https://cms.apache.org/#bookmark"&gt;javascript bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; on your browser toolbar.  Next visit a webpage on the &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;www.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; website.  When you've located a page you'd like
to edit, click on the installed bookmarklet: you'll be taken to a working copy of the markdown source for the page in question.  To edit the content click
on the [Edit] link.  A markdown editor will show you a preview of your changes while you work.  When you have finished, submit your changes and [Commit] them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your commit will trigger &lt;a href="http://ci.apache.org/#buildbot"&gt;buildbot&lt;/a&gt; to build a staging version of your changes.  You can follow the build while it is ongoing, and once it has completed you can click on the [Staged] link to see the results.  Members and Infrastructure Team members can continue on and publish those changes once they are satisfied with them.  Other committers may need to send a note to the site-dev@ mailing list to request publication of their changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The publication links in the CMS are essentially merge + commit operations in subversion which are tied into the live site via svnpubsub.  That means
publishing in the CMS is virtually instantaneous.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The CMS is now open to all top-level and incubating projects.  Interested projects should contact the infrastructure@ mailing list or simply file an &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA"&gt;INFRA&lt;/a&gt; ticket against the CMS component.  Early adopters are encouraged to collaborate on
the &lt;a href="http://wiki.apache.org/general/ApacheCms2010"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; for working out usage and adoption issues.

Shortly thereafter one of the ASF members enquired as to how he could best grab the SVN log entries for all of these commits.  As always, there were a bunch of useful replies, but they were all set to take quite some time; mainly because if anyone just simply runs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;svn log http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf -r1:1000000 &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not only take several hours, it will also cause high levels of load on one of the two geo-balanced SVN servers.  Also, requesting that many log entries will likely result in your IP address being banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to create the log set locally on one of the SVN servers.  This is now available for download  [&lt;a href="http://s.apache.org/1m-svnlog"&gt;http://s.apache.org/1m-svnlog&lt;/a&gt;]  [&lt;a href="people.apache.org/~pctony/asf-svnlog-1-1000000.tgz.md5"&gt;md5&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;br/&gt;
This is a 50Mb tar/gz file.  It will uncompress to about 240Mb.   The log 'only' contains the log entries from 1 -&amp;gt; 1,000,000  - if you want the rest you can run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;svn log http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf -r1000001:HEAD&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will give you all the log entries from 1M+1 to current&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CPU: 2x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5550  @ 2.67GHz (2 package(s) x 4 core(s) x 2 SMT threads = 16 CPUs)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new hardware replaces an older Sun T2000, also called eos, as the primary webserver for apache.org.  We hope everyone enjoys the increased performance, especially from the Wiki!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the less visible infrastructure side, we are also upgrading Athena, one of our frontend mail servers.  The new Athena is a DPE r210 with a 4 core 2.67GHz processor, replacing a Sun X2200.&lt;/p&gt;

Today we've brought &lt;a href="http://s.apache.org/"&gt;s.apache.org&lt;/a&gt; online.  It's a url shortening service that's limited to Apache committers- the people who write all that Apache software!   One of the main reasons we're providing this service is to allow committers to use shortened links whose provenance is known to be a trusted source, which is a big improvement over the generic shorteners out there in the wild.  It is also meant to provide permanent links suitable for inclusion in board reports, or more generally email sent to our mailing lists - which will be archived, either publicly or privately, for as long as Apache is around.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The service is easy to use, and being from Apache the &lt;a href="http://s.apache.org?action=source"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; for the service is readily available.    The primary author of the code is Ulrich St&amp;auml;rk (uli).  Some of the more interesting features you can pick up from the source is the ability to "display" a link before doing a redirect by tacking on "?action=display" to any shortened url. For the truly paranoid there is the "?action=display;cookie=1" query string to force &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; shortened urls to display by default before redirecting. That feature may be turned off again with the "?action=display;cookie=" query string.  Again, look over the source code for other interesting features you may wish to take advantage of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committers: here's some javascript you might consider placing in a bookmark, courtesy of Doug Cutting. To use create a new bookmark and set the link url to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apache Software Foundation uses a donated instance of &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/"&gt;Atlassian JIRA&lt;/a&gt; as an issue tracker for our projects. Among other projects, the ASF Infrastructure Team uses it to track issues and requests. Our JIRA instance was hosted on brutus.apache.org, a machine running Ubuntu Linux 8.04 LTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Password Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;If you are a user of the Apache hosted JIRA, Bugzilla, or Confluence, a hashed copy of your password has been compromised.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JIRA and Confluence both use a SHA-512 hash, but without a random salt.  We believe the risk to simple passwords based on dictionary words is quite high, and most users should rotate their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugzilla uses a SHA-256, including a random salt. The risk for most users is low to moderate, since pre-built password dictionaries are not effective, but we recommend users should still remove these passwords from use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you logged into the Apache JIRA instance between April 6th and April 9th, you should consider the password as compromised, because the attackers changed the login form to log them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happened?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 5th, the attackers via a compromised &lt;a href="http://www.slicehost.com"&gt;Slicehost&lt;/a&gt; server opened a new issue, INFRA-2591.  This issue contained the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ive got this error while browsing some projects in jira
http://tinyurl.com/XXXXXXXXX [obscured]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinyurl is a URL redirection and shortening tool.  This specific URL redirected back to the Apache instance of JIRA, at a special URL containing a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"&gt;cross site scripting (XSS) attack&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was crafted to steal the session cookie from the user logged-in to JIRA. When this issue was opened against the Infrastructure team, several of our administrators clicked on the link. This compromised their sessions, including their JIRA administrator rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time as the XSS attack, the attackers started a brute force attack against the JIRA login.jsp, attempting hundreds of thousands of password combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 6th, one of these methods was successful. Having gained administrator privileges on a JIRA account, the attackers used this account to disable notifications for a project, and to change the path used to upload attachments. The path they chose was configured to run JSP files, and was writable by the JIRA user. They then created several new issues and uploaded attachments to them. One of these attachments was a JSP file that was used to browse and copy the filesystem. The attackers used this access to create copies of many users' home directories and various files.  They also uploaded other JSP files that gave them backdoor access to the system using the account that JIRA runs under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the morning of April 9th, the attackers had installed a JAR file that would collect all passwords on login and save them. They then sent password reset mails from JIRA to members of the Apache Infrastructure team. These team members, thinking that JIRA had encountered an innocent bug, logged in using the temporary password sent in the mail, then changed the passwords on their accounts back to their usual passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these passwords happened to be the same as the password to a local user account on brutus.apache.org, and this local user account had full sudo access. The attackers were thereby able to login to brutus.apache.org, and gain full root access to the machine. This machine hosted the Apache installs of JIRA, Confluence, and Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they had root on brutus.apache.org, the attackers found that several users had cached Subversion authentication credentials, and used these passwords to log in to minotaur.apache.org (aka people.apache.org), our main shell server. On minotaur, they were unable to escalate privileges with the compromised accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 6 hours after they started resetting passwords, we noticed the attackers and began shutting down services. We notified Atlassian of the previously unreported XSS attack in JIRA and contacted SliceHost.  Atlassian was responsive.  Unfortunately, SliceHost did nothing and 2 days later, the &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; same virtual host (slice) &lt;a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/news/2010/04/oh_man_what_a_day_an_update_on_our_security_breach.html"&gt;attacked Atlassian directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started moving services to a different machine, thor.apache.org. The attackers had root access on brutus.apache.org for several hours, and we could no longer trust the operating system on the original machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By April 10th, JIRA and Bugzilla were back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 13th, Atlassian provided a patch for JIRA to prevent the XSS attack. See 
&lt;a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-20994"&gt;JRA-20994&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-20995"&gt;JRA-20995&lt;/a&gt; for details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Confluence wiki remains offline at this time. We are working to restore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What worked?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited use passwords, especially &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password"&gt;one-time passwords&lt;/a&gt;, were a real lifesaver. If JIRA passwords had been shared with other services/hosts, the attackers could have caused widespread damage to the ASF's infrastructure. Fortunately, in this case, the damage was limited to rooting a single host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service isolation worked with mixed results. The attackers must be presumed to have copies of our Confluence and Bugzilla databases, as well as our JIRA database, at this point. These databases include hashes of all passwords used on those systems. However, other services and hosts, including LDAP, were largely unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What didn't work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The primary problem with our JIRA install is that the JIRA daemon runs as the user who installed JIRA. In this case, it runs as a jira role-account. There are historical reasons for this decision, but with 20/20 hindsight, and in light of the security issues at stake, we expect to revisit the decision!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same password should not have been used for a JIRA account as was used for sudo access on the host machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inconsistent application of one time passwords; We required them on other machines, but not on brutus.  PAM was configured to allow optional use of OPIE, but not all of our sudoers had switched to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH passwords should not have been enabled for login over the Internet. Although the Infrastructure Team had attempted to configure the sshd daemon to disable password-based logins, having &lt;code&gt;UsePAM yes&lt;/code&gt; set meant that password-based logins were still possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use &lt;a href="http://www.fail2ban.org"&gt;Fail2Ban&lt;/a&gt; for many services, but we did not have it configured to track JIRA login failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are we changing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have remedied the JIRA installation issues with our reinstall. JIRA is now installed by root and runs as a separate daemon with limited privileges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the time being we are running JIRA in a httpd-tomcat proxy config with the following rules:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
   ProxyPass /jira/secure/popups/colorpicker.jsp !
   ProxyPass /jira/secure/popups/grouppicker.jsp !
   ProxyPass /jira/secure/popups/userpicker.jsp !
   ProxyPass /jira        http://127.0.0.1:18080/jira
&lt;/code&gt;

Sysadmins may find this useful to secure their JIRA installation until an upgrade is feasible.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We will be making one-time-passwords mandatory for all super-users, on all of our Linux and FreeBSD hosts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We have disabled caching of svn passwords, and removed all currently cached svn passwords across all hosts ast the ASF via the global config &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/etc/subversion/config&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; file:

  
  &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
[auth]
store-passwords = no
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Fail2Ban to protect web application login failures from brute force attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope our disclosure has been as open as possible and true to the ASF spirit. Hopefully others can learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

This works well for us, but did present us with some initial problems when setting up our Buildbot instance to work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that others have the same or similar arrangement with their svn instance, we thought we would share how we got Buildbot working well for us. Note that this is not a tutorial on Buildbot, more of a quick mini guide with more code than explanation, hoping you'll work out the rest for your needs.We will be working with four files:- svn_buildbot.py, post-commit, buildbot_project_paths and master.cfg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, we needed to alter a section of the svn_buildbot.py file that comes in the buildbot/contrib directory. We copied this file to our svn host machine and edited this section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;def split_file_branches(changed_file, project_paths):
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pieces = changed_file.split(os.sep)
#Assume the layout is something like :
# trunk =&amp;amp;gt; foo/bar/baz/trunk/file
# branches/test  =&amp;amp;gt; foo/bar/baz/branches/test/file
# Slurp everything up to one of these 2 'markers' and call that the branch
found = False

f = open(project_paths, 'r')
for line in f.readlines():
    line = line.strip()
    regexp = re.compile(line)
    m = regexp.match(changed_file)
    if m:
        branch = m.group(1)
        path =   m.group(2)
        print &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; sys.stderr, &amp;amp;quot;branch=%s, path=%s&amp;amp;quot; % (branch, path)
        return (branch, path)


i = 0
for piece in pieces:
    i = i + 1	
    # Find trunk, we are done
    if piece == 'trunk':
        found = True
        break
    elif piece == 'branches':
        i = i + 1
        found = True
        break
    
# We found a layout we know, so send it to buildbot
if found:
    branch = os.path.join(*pieces[0:i]) 
    path =   os.path.join(*pieces[i:])
else:        
    branch = pieces[0]
    path = os.path.join(*pieces[1:])
        
print &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; sys.stderr, &amp;amp;quot;branch=%s, path=%s&amp;amp;quot; % (branch, path)
return (branch, path)     
   
#return (pieces[0], os.path.join(*pieces[1:]))

raise RuntimeError(&amp;amp;quot;cannot determine branch for '%s'&amp;amp;quot; % changed_file)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;split_file = split_file_branches
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up , the relevant entry in our subversion/hooks/post-commit file looks like this (with&amp;nbsp;constants defined earlier in the file): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;    $SVNLOOK dirs-changed -r "$REV" "$REPOS" | egrep -qf "$BUILDBOT_PROJECT_PATHS" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 
( $BUILDBOT --repository "$REPOS" --revision "$REV" --bbserver "$BBSERVER" --bbport "$BBPORT" 
--project-paths "$BUILDBOT_PROJECT_PATHS" &amp;gt;&amp;gt;/var/log/svn_buildbot.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp; )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, last but not least for the svn host side of things, our buildbot_project_paths file which contains entries such as :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;^(&lt;strong&gt;incubator/wookie/trunk&lt;/strong&gt;)/(.*)
^(stdcxx/trunk)/(.*)
^(incubator/trafficserver/traffic/trunk)/(.*)
^(incubator/trafficserver/traffic/branches/2.0.x)/(.*)
^(subversion/trunk)/(.*)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you create an entry from the svn base directory for each projects trunk or branch that you want Buildbot to take notice of, the rest being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we match those buildbot_project_paths entries in our master.cfg file with an AnyBranchScheduler like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# schedulers
from buildbot.scheduler import AnyBranchScheduler
&lt;p&gt;c['schedulers'].append(AnyBranchScheduler(name="on-wookie-commit",
branches=["&lt;strong&gt;incubator/wookie/trunk&lt;/strong&gt;"],
treeStableTimer=2,
builderNames=["wookie-trunk"]))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#builders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f28 = factory.BuildFactory()
f28.addStep(SVN(
mode="clobber",
baseURL="&lt;a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/"&gt;http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/&lt;/a&gt;",
defaultBranch="&lt;strong&gt;incubator/wookie/trunk&lt;/strong&gt;",
haltOnFailure=True,
))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to tie it all together, what we have done is created a workflow like this:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A commit happens, the post-commit file checks the buildbot_project_paths file to see if it is relevant to any of our projects. If not, nothing else happens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we have a match then svn_buildbot.py is called, and uses the entry in buildbot_project_paths as the branch with the root dir of svn as the base, then sends these two pieces of information over to the Buildbot master. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Buildbot master checks its config, finds a match in the 'branches' entry for our AnyBranchScheduler and triggers the appropriate build. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps someone out there , at least, until Buildbot project changes again, it is a fast moving project currently! - 0.80 for instance has introduced the 'project' property and the 'repository' property for schedulers which may negate the need for some of this, but I haven't investigated to date. (See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://github.com/djmitche/buildbot/blob/buildbot-0.8.0/NEWS"&gt;http://github.com/djmitche/buildbot/blob/buildbot-0.8.0/NEWS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more info on that.)&lt;/p&gt;

have now been restored. We have analyzed the events that led to the breach, and continued to work on improving the security of our systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: At
no time were any Apache Software Foundation code repositories, downloads, or users put at risk by this intrusion. However, we believe that providing a detailed account
of what happened will make the internet a better place, by allowing others to learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happened?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our initial running theory was correct--the server that hosted
the apachecon.com (dv35.apachecon.com) website had been compromised. The machine was running CentOS, and we
suspect they may have used the recent local root exploits &lt;a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1222.html"&gt;patched in RHSA-2009-1222&lt;/a&gt; to escalate their privileges on this machine. The attackers fully compromised
this machine, including gaining root privileges, and destroyed most of
the logs, making it difficult for us to confirm the details of
everything that happened on the machine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This machine is owned by the ApacheCon conference production company,
not by
the Apache Software Foundation. However, members of the ASF
infrastructure team had accounts on this machine, including one used to
create backups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
attackers attempted unsuccessfully to use passwords from the compromised ApacheCon
host to log on to our production webservers.&amp;nbsp; Later, using the SSH Key of the backup account, they were able to access
people.apache.org (minotaur.apache.org). This account was an unprivileged user, used
to create backups from the ApacheCon host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;minotaur.apache.org runs FreeBSD 7-STABLE, and acts as the staging machine for our mirror
network. It is
our primary shell account server, and provides many other services for Apache developers. None of our Subversion (version control) data is kept on this machine, and there was never any risk to any Apache source code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once
the attackers had gained shell access, they added CGI scripts to the document root folders of
several of our websites. A regular, scheduled rsync process copied these scripts to our
production web server, eos.apache.org, where they became externally
visible. The CGI scripts were used to obtain remote shells, with information sent using HTTP POST commands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our download pages are
dynamically generated, to enable us to present users with a local mirror of our software. This means that all of our domains have &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options"&gt;ExecCGI enabled&lt;/a&gt;, making it harder for us to protect against an attack of this nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After
discovering the CGI scripts, the infrastructure team decided to shutdown
any servers that could potentially have been affected. This included people.apache.org, and both the EU
and US website servers. All website traffic was redirected to a known-good
server, and a temporary security message was put in place to let people
know we were aware of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One by one, we brought the potentially-affected servers up, in single user mode, using our out of band access. It quickly became clear that aurora.apache.org, the EU website server, had not been affected. Although the CGI scripts had been rsync'd to that machine, they had never been run. This machine was not included in the DNS rotation at the time of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;aurora.apache.org runs Solaris 10, and we were
able to restore the box to a known-good configuration by cloning
and promoting a ZFS snapshot from a day before the CGI scripts were synced
over. Doing so enabled us to bring the EU server back online, and to rapidly restore our main websites. Thereafter, we continued to analyze the cause of the breach, the method of access, and which, if any, other machines had been compromised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after bringing up
aurora.apache.org we determined that the most likely route of the breach was
the backup routine from dv35.apachecon.com. We grabbed all the
available logs from dv35.apachecon.com, and promptly shut it down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis continued on minotaur.apache.org and eos.apache.org (our US
server), until we were confident that all remnants of the attackers had been removed. As each server was declared clean, it was brought back online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What worked?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The use of ZFS snapshots enabled us to restore the EU production web server to a known-good state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Redundant
services in two locations allowed us to run services from an alternate
location while continuing to work on the affected servers and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A non-uniform set of compromised machines
(Linux/CentOS i386, FreeBSD-7 amd_64, and Solaris 10 on sparc) made it
difficult for the attackers to escalate privileges on multiple machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What didn't work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
use of SSH keys facilitated this attack. In hindsight, our implementation left a lot to be
desired--we did not restrict SSH keys appropriately, and we were
unaware of their misuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rsync setup, which uses people.apache.org to manage the deployment of our websites, enabled the attackers to get their files onto the US mirror, undetected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to run CGI scripts in any virtual host, when most of our websites do not need this functionality, made us unnecessarily vulnerable to an attack of this nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of logs from the ApacheCon host prevents us from conclusively determining the full
course of action taken by the attacker. All but one log file were deleted by the attacker, and logs were not kept off the machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What changes we are making now?&lt;/h2&gt;As a result of
this intrusion we are making several changes, to help further secure our
infrastructure from such issues in the future. These changes include the following:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requiring all users with &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/one-time-passwords.html"&gt;elevated privileges to use  OPIE for sudo&lt;/a&gt; on certain machines.&amp;nbsp; We already require this in some places, but will expand its use as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recreating
and using new SSH keys, one per host, for backups.&amp;nbsp; Also enforcing use of the
from="" and command="" strings in the authorized keys file on the
destination backup server. In tandem with access restrictions which only allow connections
from machines that are actually backing up data, this will prevent 3rd party
machines from being able to establish an SSH connection.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
command="" string in the authorized_keys file is now explicit, and only allows one way rsync traffic, due to the paths and flags used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New keys have been generated for all hosts, with a minimum key length of at least 4096 bits .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
VM that hosted the old apachecon.com site remains powered down, awaiting
further detailed analysis.&amp;nbsp; The apachecon.com website has been re-deployed on a
new VM, with a new provider and different operating system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are looking at disabling CGI support on most of our website systems.&amp;nbsp; This has led to the creation of &lt;a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/mod_asf_mirrorcgi/mod_asf_mirrorcgi.c"&gt;a new httpd module&lt;/a&gt; that will handle things like mirror locations for downloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
method by which most of our public facing websites are deployed to our production servers will also change, becoming a much more automated process. We hope to have switched over to a &lt;a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/svnpubsub/svnpubsub.py"&gt;SvnSubPub&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/svnpubsub/svnwcsub.py"&gt;SvnWcSub&lt;/a&gt; based system within the next few weeks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will re-implement measures such as IP banning after several failed logins, on all machines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A
proposal has been made to introduce centralized logging. This would include all system logs, and possibly also services such as smtpd and httpd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Minotaur serves as the seed host for most apache.org websites, in
addition to providing shell accounts for all Apache committers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
attackers created several files in the directory containing files for
www.apache.org, including several CGI scripts.&amp;nbsp; These files were then
rsynced to our production webservers by automated processes.&amp;nbsp; At about
07:00 on August 28 2009 the attackers accessed these CGI scripts over
HTTP, which spawned processes on our production web services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At about 07:45 UTC we noticed these rogue processes on eos.apache.org, the Solaris 10 machine that normally serves our websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the next 10 minutes we decided to shutdown all machines involved as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After
an initial investigation we changed DNS for most apache.org services to
eris.apache.org, a machine not affected and provided a basic downtime
message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigation, we determined that our European fallover and backup machine, aurora.apache.org, was not affected.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While
the some files had been copied to the machine by automated rsync
processes, none of them were executed on the host, and we restored from
a ZFS snapshot to a version of all our websites before any accounts
were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time several machines remain offline, but most user facing websites and services are now available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will provide more information as we can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a slightly more complicated migration as we currently use an SVNAuthz file, that contains the appropriate groups and their memberships. &amp;nbsp;We are currently working on a new template system where by changes to LDAP will trigger a build of the SVNAuthz file based on groups in LDAP. &amp;nbsp;This means we must watch LDAP changes, work on a template system, and if a new version of the template is checked into Subversion we need to trigger a build again. &amp;nbsp;This is a work in progress at the moment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in the position of needing to change your shell account password you can do it by doing this on the command line "ldappasswd -W -S -A -D uid=availid,ou=people,dc=apache,dc=org" &amp;nbsp;-- Where availid is your ASF username. &amp;nbsp; For example &amp;nbsp;"ldappasswd -W -S -A -D uid=pctony,ou=people,dc=apache,dc=org". &amp;nbsp;This is far from an elegant solution, but for now it works. &amp;nbsp;You will be required to enter and confirm your current password, and then enter and confirm your new password choice, followed by your LDAP password (this is your old password) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working on a web portal that will allow users to edit attributes, such as forwarding address, password, etc. &amp;nbsp;This will be made available as soon as it is ready. &amp;nbsp;If you don't know your current password, then you will need to email &amp;nbsp;root@ as per usual.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can follow the trials and tribulations of the rollout on my personal &lt;a href="http://blog.pc-tony.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
