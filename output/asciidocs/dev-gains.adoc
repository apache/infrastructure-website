= Developer Gains with Gradle

while we're not racecar drivers, we do depend on high end machines to help us
cross the finish line of releasing software. CI and Build systems have bubbles to the
top of the list of ASF Infra offerings of interest. most if not all of the projects here use
a build system of some sort.

Gradle and ASF Infra have partnered to ensure that you're getting the most out of what
we're able to offer.

I understand that many of you already know these terms, but just in case I'd like to ensure
that we're all reading from the same dictionary. so I'm going to define a few things

build-time refers to the time a build spends occupying build resources.
* 1 build day is 24 hours of non-stop work for a worker node.
* whether it's 1 24 hour build or 24 1 hour builds doesn't matter. it's 24 hours of build-time.

Flaky tests are tests that _may_ pass on a second (or third) run.

== The Need for Speed.

Right now, We're seeing an average savings of 12 minutes per build. which admittedly doesn't
sound like a lot on its face but that's 81 days worth of build time over the course of the last
10K builds.

Build caching alone is responsible for 61 of those 81 days saved.
Gradle's Build caching is lowering precious build time spent generating or regenerating
build artifacts.

I feel this is made even more incredible because we don't even have the full roster of projects
using Gradle. As we onboard more projects we expect to see even more time savings.

Local and Remote build caching enables savings of an average of over 13 minutes per build.
or 90-100 build-days per calendar week.

== Better resource utilization.
[%step]
* Build time avoidance savings correlate directly to build queue times.
* Efficient Ephemeral Node usage.
    
All of this to say: builds are getting done faster, sooner.

== How do I use this?
* the GE instance is publicly available at ge.apache.org
