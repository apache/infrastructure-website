<p id="infra-lists">Participation in the Infra mailing lists is only available to ASF committers.</p>

You can subscribe in the normal way. The moderators will verify that you are an ASF committer, so please either use your `@apache.org` address or its forwarding address. There are public archives for issues@ and site-dev@; all other infra@ lists are private. (We often call it "infra@" because that is less typing, but there is no such list.)</p>

<p id="private-lists">The infra@ mailing lists are (mostly) private. You must not forward messages from there to public lists. Forwarding to more private mailing lists (like a pmc mailing list, the board, or the members mailing list) might be appropriate on some occasions. Ask if in doubt.</p>

<h2 id="lists">The lists</h2>

  - `users@infra`: Infra uses the general discussion list to discuss issues concerning the operation of the Apache Software Foundation systems, and for committers to report problems or issues. <strong>This is not the address for questions about
the ASF or any of its projects.</strong> It is for communication between ASF committers <em>only</em> to support the infrastructure. Anyone may send mail to report problems with ASF systems, but check <a href="https://status.apache.org/" target="_blank">the status page</a> before mailing to see whether Infra already knows about what you have noticed.
  - `private@infra`: For the core infra@ team only. It focuses on the infrastructure team working directly on pressing issues. Infra moderates subscriptions, which are restricted to ASF members and current infra [volunteers](infra-volunteer.html). Only
subscribers can post. 
  - `commits@infra`: SVN commit messages for the ASF Infrastructure trunk, and Git commit messages for ASF Infra.
  - `issues@infra`: Messages from the INFRA Issue Tracker. Only ASF committers and people invited by the infra@ team can join. To "post" to this list, file a Jira comment which Jira sends to the list.
  - `site-cvs@`: Private lists for SVN commit messages for the ASF Infrastructure website.
  - `site-dev@`: A list for discussion of every aspect of the small number of websites that are centrally managed by the
ASF (e.g. /dev/) and for co-ordination of infrastructure needs and publishing methods for all ASF project websites. Participation is open to to any committer or interested party invited by a committer (by sending an email to site-dev-owner). The list is normally low volume.
  - `infrastructure-dev@`: This list was closed in October, 2016 and not replaced. Instead please use `users@infra`. It was dedicated to developing and documenting software tools for potential ASF infrastructure.
