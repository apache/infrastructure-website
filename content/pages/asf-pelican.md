Title: ASF-Pelican

When the ASF content management system, which projects used from 2010, reached end of life in 2021, Infra provided several options to which PMCs could move their project websites.

Infra also created ASF-Pelican as a structure and template for projects still on the CMS and for the ASF's own website. It is also available for any ASF project that wants to consider using it. The template is available at <a href="https://github.com/apache/template-site" target="_blank">github.com/apache/template-site</a>.

Review the following information to simplify your work with, and get your best results from, the template:
