Title: About the Apache Infrastructure Team

# ASF Infra
The ASF Infrastructure team, known as **Infra**, provides and manages all infrastructure and services for the Apache Software Foundation, and for each project that is part of the Foundation. This infrastructure includes the various machines and their operating systems, mailing lists, version control systems, committer accounts, the distribution mirroring system, and issue tracking systems. Infra is responsible for systems administration and security, and supports existing projects at The Apache Software Foundation. Infra works hard to provide services and setup for each new project that joins the Foundation via the Apache Incubator.

## About us
The ASF Infrastructure team is made up of ASF committers, some of whom are paid sysadmin contractors. Like every ASF project, the non-contracted committers work as volunteers - and we could always do with more help! Those volunteers work alongside the contractors in support of decisions approved, either implicitly or explicitly, by the Infrastructure President's Committee. Decision-making follows a distributed hierarchy instead of the typical fully group-centric decision-making of an Apache project.

## How we help
The Apache Infrastructure team exists to ensure the day-to-day operations of the technical aspects of the foundation. If you have questions about or require support regarding email, code repositories, web sites, issue trackers and so forth, we are here to [help](help.html)! 

## How can you help?
Volunteers are the driving force of the Apache Software Foundation. The Infrastructure team is always looking for people willing to help out at whatever effort level suits you. If you're interested, visit our [volunteer information](infra-volunteer.html) page.
