Title: Policy on sharing sensitive information with Infra
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

It is sometimes necessary for you to share sensitive information with the Infrastructure team so that Infra can resolve a problem:

  - Your LDAP credentials no longer work
  - Your project's code has a security vulnerability
  - You need to share personally-identifying information (PII), yours or someone else's
  - You need to pass an organization secret to Infra to be stored in GitHub

**Do not** share such information on an ASF Slack channel, a public email thread, as a comment on a Jira ticket, or as a GitHub issue.

**Do** share it in an email to `root@infra.apache.org`. **Do not** copy or blind-copy the message you are sending to any other address.
