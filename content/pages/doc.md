#### Website, blog and wiki ####
- [Project website guidelines](website-guidelines.html). **Note**: No new projects can use the Apache CMS, which has reached end-of-life. Any projects still using the CMS must migrate to another resource to maintain their websites. Projects that have not migrated their site may find that they are no longer able to update it.
- Here is how one project <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/How+Apache+Jena+migrated+from+the+CMS" target="_blank">did the migration</a>.
- A [project site template](asf-pelican.html) written in Pelican is available to smooth migration away from the CMS, and to support creation of new project sites.
