license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

The <a href="https://translate.apache.org/" target="_blank">ASF Translation Service</a> provides the **Pootle** localization tool to help projects that want to provide documentation and user-interface text in multiple languages. *NOTE*: While several ASF projects continue to use Pootle, AFS is not approving new Pootle use. 

<a href="https:tomcat.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a> uses <a href="https://poeditor.com/" target="_blank">POEditor</a> to localize its log messages and other text. POEditor provides free, unlimited licenses to open-source projects. PMC member Mark Thomas provided a description of <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Localization+-+Apache+Tomcat%27s+process+using+POEditor" target="_blank">the Tomcat localization process</a>.
