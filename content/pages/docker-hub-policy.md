**Docker** is an open source containerization platform. Developers can package applications in **containers**, components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. 

<a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> is the world's largest public registry for hosting Docker images. It is the default download source when you are working with Docker.

A **Docker image** is a file with a set of instructions for building a Docker container. It is like a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments. When a user runs an image, it can become one or many instances of a container.

PMCs can host product releases on Docker Hub for users to download, build, and deploy. The ASF has a limited number of Docker Hub seats, so there is a limit of **two seats per PMC**. Request a seat or seats for your PMC in a Jira ticket for Infra, with a link to the PMC email conversation that justifies the request. If you feel your PMC needs additional seats, explain the special circumstances in the ticket.
