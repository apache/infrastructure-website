Title: Project and product names

When choosing a name for a new Apache project, or for a new downloadable software product within an existing Apache project, we need to ensure the 
new name will be suitable. We want to ensure that the new name won't infringe on or unduly conflict with any existing software products, and to understand how well the ASF and 
the project will be able to defend our use of the name.

These are general guidelines for considering new names for podlings undergoing Incubation and for existing projects creating new software products or subprojects. PPMC/PMC members must read the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/naming.html" target="_blank">detailed name search process</a> so they can properly **conduct a search**.

  - The purpose of trademarks is to reduce the likelihood of confusion for users attempting to find our software, to distinguish our software from software coming from some other organization or individual.
  - Trademarks exist by virtue of use, not just because we have registered them. Once we publicly release a downloadable software product called Apache Foo, and consistently refer to it with that name, Apache Foo is our common-law trademark for that software.
  The fact that a word or phrase is not registered as a trademark does not necessarily indicate that it is available for our use. If the mark is used by others in commerce, even if it is not registered, we still cannot use it for our projects or products.
  - Trademarks only apply within a specific class of goods - for us, that is "software products" - and, to a degree, only with products of similar functionality.
