Title: ASF Pelican plugins

# Plugins
You can find the available plugins for a site using the ASF-Pelican template in the `themes/plugins` folder of your website's project repository.

# Plugin architecture

The plugins operate at various points in a Pelican build.

Pelican uses <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#list-of-signals" target="_blank">signals</a> at various points.

Here is a high-level review of the sequence of events:

## Pelican settings

Settings for a Pelican build are in your Pelican configuration file, `pelicanconf.py`. Here is where you list the plugins you are using.

```python
PLUGIN_PATHS = ['./theme/plugins']
PLUGINS = ['asfgenid', 'asfdata', 'pelican-gfm', 'asfreader']
```

## Initialization

At initialization, Pelican reads any ASF_DATA into a metadata dictionary that is available in every page in the site.

- The plugin `.asfdata.py` reads an `.asfdata.yaml` file and creates the metadata dictionary.

```python
ASF_DATA_YAML = ".asfdata.yaml"
ASF_DATA = {
    'data': ASF_DATA_YAML,
    'metadata': { },
    'debug': True
}
```

- The asfgenid plugin `./asfgenid.py` configures the site's features.

```python
# Configure the asfgenid plugin
ASF_GENID = {
    'metadata': True,
    'elements': True,
    'headings': True,
    'headings_re': r'^h[1-4]',
    'permalinks': True,
    'toc': True,
    'toc_headers': r"h[1-4]",
    'tables': True,
    'debug': False
}
```

## Readers (readers_init)

The system sets two important readers at this point. Readers are responsible for transforming page files to html and
providing a metadata dictionary.

- GFMReader by the pelican-gfm plugin. This code is in a private repository - ask Infra. Transforms GitHub Flavored Markdown(GFM) to HTML.
 
 * .md
  * .markdown
  * .mkd
  * .mdown

- `ASFReader, `.asfreader.py) transforms an <a href="https://github.com/gstein/ezt" target="_blank">ezt template</a> into GFM and then to HTML.
  
  * .ezmd

## Content init (content_object_init)

This is signaled after a reader has processed the site's content. At this point plugins can review, record, and transform the html content.

- The asfgenid plugin, `./asfgenid.py`, performs a number of steps. Some of the steps are optional.
  * Metadata transformation by looking up {{ key_expression }} in the page metadata.
  * Inventory of existing ID attributes.
  * Set ID and class attributes specified by {#id} and {.class} syntax.
  * Assign an ID to any headings without IDs.
  * Insert a table of contents if a [TOC] tag is present.

## Apache CMS

Many projects had their websites served by the Apache CMS from 2010. It is deprecated as of the summer of 2021. The CMS was written in Perl. We have a new approach that fits Pelican. 

If you want to look into the old CMS process, its <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/infrastructure/site/trunk/lib/views" target="_blank">Subversion repository and history</a> remain available.
