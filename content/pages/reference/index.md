As of now we have a couple places for documentation; this new website hopes to
collate them and provide a single or primary point of reference.

[Confluence](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Index): just like
other projects we use Confluence for How-To's, meeting notes and other tidbits.

This directory contains various reference articles for Committers, PMC members and Infrastructure:
