= How-to Infra
:imagesdir: images
With Chris Wells And Chris Thistlethwaite from your ASF Infra Team

== ASF Infra
* Infra is a team operating under the VP of Infrastructure
* There are 9 of us, 6 full-time, 2 part-time, and 1 volunteer (VP Infra)
* Located in the EU, US, and Canada covering +2 UTC to -7 UTC
* 1 team member on-call at a time 24/7/365; rotating weekly

== Not Your Average IT Department

=== Some other company

=== Infra's Structure
image::how_to_infra-infra_structure.png[]

=== Why is that important?
* Individual Infra members have some autonomy and discretion
* I don't think escalation  means what you think it means
* We are professionals, you are professionals

=== Why is that important? (cont)
* The Foundation handles legal, privacy, and DEI policy
* Infra handles operational policy

== Why We Say "No"
We enforce the policy created by members, committers, the board, us, gnomes, ponies, etc.

=== Policy
* Legal
* Privacy
* Technical
* Resources
* Ongoing maintenance

== How to Communicate With Us

=== Methods of Contact
* Jira tickets (https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA/issues/)
* Mailing lists (users@infra.apache.org)

=== Communication is a Two-way Street
* Able and willing to discuss rationale
