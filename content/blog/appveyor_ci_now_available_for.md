<p><span style="font-stretch: normal;">The ASF Infrastructure team is happy to announce that projects can how have AppVeyor CI setup on their GitHub mirrors.</span></p> 
  <p>&nbsp;The only thing you need to do is create an INFRA ticket at <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA/">issues.apache.org</a> with the following information:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Repo Name</li> 
    <li>Mailing list to send build notifications to (optional)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>There are already a few projects using AppVeyor on their GitHub mirror, and we now have an Organization role account for central management (and I have gone through an updated previous tickets with new links to badges).</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>If you have any questions, you can ask us in <a href="http://infra.chat/">Hipchat</a> or you can email infrastructure@apache.org<br /></p> 
  <p> </p>
