<hr/>
**Note**: Until June, 2023, the ASF supported using Apache Roller for project blogs. That support has ended. Please visit <a href="https://infra.apache.org/project-blogs.html" target="_blank">Project Blog</a> for more information about blogs for projects.
<hr/>

<p>Previously, to be able to preview a draft post by any Roller Blog, one had to be a member user of that blog.</p><p>For those that would like an easy way to post previews of drafts for lazy consensus or voting, a script has been setup to allow the preview URL that Roller generates to be shared publicly. &nbsp;For example:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (roller preview url)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 13px; "><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/roller-ui/authoring/preview/test/?previewEntry=testing">https://blogs.apache.org/roller-ui/authoring/preview/test/?previewEntry=testing</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (public preview url)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.apache.org/preview/test/?previewEntry=testing"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small; ">https://blogs.apache.org/preview/test/?previewEntry=testing</span></a></p><p>A typical process is to create the blog post, set it up to publish in&nbsp;3-4 days via the &quot;Advanced Settings&quot;, then post the modified preview URL to your dev@ list with the anticipated publish date for lazy consensus.</p><p>Projects must opt-in by adding the &quot;preview&quot; user with &quot;Limited&quot; access.</p><p>Details here:</p><p><a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/blogs.html">http://www.apache.org/dev/blogs.html&nbsp;</a></p>
