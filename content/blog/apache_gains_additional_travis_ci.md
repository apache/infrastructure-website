<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><a href="https://travis-ci.org" target="_blank">Travis-CI</a> is a distributed continuous integration platform that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">integrates well with projects on GitHub. As many of our projects are&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">taking advantage of our <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/improved_integration_between_apache_and" target="_blank">GitHub integration</a>, they're also making use of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Travis-CI for testing of inbound patches.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;" /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Travis CI offers a free account for open source projects, with a built&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">in assumption that projects are generally a single project per GitHub&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">organization. The level of resources and jobs able to run is 'fair&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">use', which is fair indeed considering that is gratis.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;" /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Of course, most GitHub organizations aren't as large as the Apache organization&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">on GitHub, and we recently discovered that the Foundation was one of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">largest gratis open source user of Travis CI.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;On average, our build queue length was in excess of 300 jobs.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">While we appreciate the generosity of the Travis-CI folks, our demand&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">for their services was clearly outstripping the available supply. This&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">also meant that a lot of Apache projects were frustrated, or even&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">abandoning their efforts to use Travis-CI because the length of time&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">for a build to start was high enough to not really quality as&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">'continuous'.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;" /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">To that end, we've now purchased a subscription to Travis services,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">and have moved from 'fair use' to having 30 concurrent builds. This&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">should be a dramatic increase in throughput for Apache projects who make use of Travis.</span>
