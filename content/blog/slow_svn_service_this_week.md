Title: Slow SVN Service This Week

<p>In preparation for upgrading Subversion to the latest version (1.6.0), we are running an svn dump on svn.apache.org.&nbsp; This will chew up enough disk IO to be noticeable to svn users.&nbsp; We expect the dump to finish sometime during this weekend.<br />&nbsp;</p>
