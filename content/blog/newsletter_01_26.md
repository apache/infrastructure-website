**Welcome to Inside Infra for January, 2026**


### Roundtable

There was no January Roundtable.

The next Roundtable will be **Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 1800 UTC** (moved one week because so many people will be involved in FOSDEM at the start of the month). Jarek Potiuk will be presenting on the **software dependency tracker** he developed, and on **using AI in code development**.

See <a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank">infra.apache.org/roundtable.html</a> for details about how to join a roundtable, and what happens at it. 

### Response to survey responses

At the end of 2023, Infra conducted a survey, looking for feedback on how the team and the ASF infrastructure are working. It was good to see that, for instance, 95% of respondents felt that Infra offers adequate technical services for their project. ([2023 Infra Survey response](2023%20Infra%20Survey%20Results.html).)

Many respondents took the time to identify areas which needed improvement, but the Infra team never got around to acknowledging and responding to those comments and suggestions, until now.

Our responses to the significant suggestions and comments are at [Responding to the 2024 Infra survey](responding_to_2024_survey.html).

Infra will invite you to take part in our next survey sometime in the coming months.

More next month!
