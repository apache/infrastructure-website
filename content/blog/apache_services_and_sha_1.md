<p>
As some of you may have already encountered, certain services within Apache appear to have broken SSL support. While the cert is still valid, there is a part of the cert that both Microsoft and Google have stopped accepting as valid. We are working on fixing this and will use this blogpost to track what services will be updated and when (as well as emails).</p>
