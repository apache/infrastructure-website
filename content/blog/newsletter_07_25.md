Welcome to _Inside Infra_ for July, 2025

**Roundtable**

At the July Roundtable, Daniel Gruno presented on the **catalog server**, now in development: <a href="https://catalog-test.apache.org/lookup/project" target="_blank">catalog-test.apache.org/lookup/project</a>. The plan is to move all metadata that the Foundation and projects use into one place for reference and research:

  - membership details
  - the details of every .asf.yaml file in use

Infra is working in tandem with the Tooling team to develop this service. We are assembling the list of metadata at the moment. When the service is complete, you will, we hope, have one place to go to find ASF-related information you need.

In general discussion, Jarek Potiuk described  a tool he has developed to help the Airflow project better understand their **dependency universe**. Their product has about 700 dependencies. This tool shows, among other interesting things, which dependencies they cannot upgrade without code rework. It provides warnings about what Airflow cannot currently upgrade, and where the work must be done-â€“for instance, the problem may be with a dependency of a dependency. Work still has to be done, but this tool helps Airflow discover quickly _where_ the work has to happen.

It is worth noting that the roundtable is not just for receiving what Infra wants to present. Often, the most interesting discoveries and conversations come out of what non-Infra people around the table have to share. There is a lot of exciting stuff going on among The ASF's projects, and here is one place where you can find out about them early.

Complete notes from the meeting are at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2025-07-02+1700+UTC" target="_blank">Infra Roundtable 2025-07-02 1700 UTC</a>.

The next Roundtable will be **Wednesday, August 6, 1700 UTC**, and we will be talking about **AI scraping and The ASF**. There will also be time for news from projects and questions from participants.

Looking ahead, the **September Roundtable** will be a face-to face event on **September 14 at Community Over Code**, the ASF conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: <a href="https://communityovercode.org/" target="_blank">communityvercode.org</a>. The entire Infra and Tooling team track is on the 14th, the last day of the event; and if you are attending, we hope you can join us.
