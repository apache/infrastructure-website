<p>Hi All,</p> 
  <p> <a href="https://blogs.apache.org" title="blogs.apache.org main site">blogs.apache.org</a> &nbsp; - the site you are reading now! has had a bit of an update.<br /></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>1. We moved it from an aged VM Host to the Cloud (thanks LeaseWeb!)</p> 
  <p>2. We puppetised the entire service, from install to deploy (see our <a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/tree/deployment/modules/blogs_asf" title="GitHub Mirror of infrastructure-puppet">GitHub</a> Mirror )</p> 
  <p>3. We upgraded the Apache Roller software from 5.0.3 to the latest 5.1.2</p> 
  <p>4. We enabled LDAP for logins. That's right! Every single ASF Committer can now just login! No more creating an INFRA Jira ticket just to get a Roller account on <a href="http://blogs.apache.org">blogs.apache.org</a></p> 
  <p> Other stuff remains the same - meaning if you are a Blog Administrator you still need to invite committers into your blog, you still need to choose to make them an Author or Admin etc - Roller doesn't support anything more than login auth for LDAP currently - but I bet the <a href="https://roller.apache.org" title="roller project website">project</a> would love to see the LDAP integration extended and improved if you feel the need!.</p> 
  <p>Anyhow, our first new year present to our ASF Committers, a shiny updated blog instance,</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;Enjoy, and have a great 2017!!<br /></p> 
  <p><br /></p>
