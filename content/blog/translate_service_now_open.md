A few projects have requested it, now it is here! Check out <a href="https://translate.apache.org">https://translate.apache.org</a> and get your project added.</p>
  <p>See also <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/translate+pootle+service+auth+levels">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/translate+pootle+service+auth+levels</a> for more information - you will see that general public non-logged in users can submit translate requests whilst any logged in user (i.e. - committers) can process those submissions.</p>
  <p>Enjoy! - Any queries to the infra team please or file a INFRA Jira ticket.</p>
