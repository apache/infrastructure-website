      <div>The ReviewBoard vm ran out of space and despite our best 
efforts to fix the space issue without restarting the service, that is 
the only option left.<br /><br /></div>The plan is to restart the vm on 
Thursday August 20th at 21:00 UTC (14:00 PDT), but if it fills up again 
before then, the resize will take place earlier.<br /><br /> 
    </div>A tweet via @infrabot will be tweeted 1 hour before the scheduled downtime and a planned maintenance notice will be posted to <a href="http://status.apache.org" target="_blank">status.apache.org</a>.<br /><br /> 
  </div>The actual downtime should take no more than 30 minutes.<br /><br />The next email about this will be after the service has resumed from the <span>planned</span> downtime.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Geoff Corey
