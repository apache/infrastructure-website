We had announced the start of this migration on June 15, 2022.</p><p class="auto-cursor-target" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(23, 43, 77); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;">At approximately 17:33 UTC the bulk of our migration operations had completed, and mail was flowing again. The team continued to address and monitor issues arising as a result of the migration, and the mailing list services were deemed fully operational at approximately 20:00 UTC.</p>
