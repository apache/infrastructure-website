**Welcome to *Inside Infra* for November, 2025*

## Roundtable

The November Roundtable featured a demonstration of the current state of a new **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** system which Infra hopes to bring live soon The system is working from end to end, but a lot of automation needs to be completed before we can open the system for beta testing. We also need to finalize which services will require MFA.

The plan is for the MFA system to be opt-in at first and only become mandatory for certain systems once we are sure it is sturdy and performs well.

The new system will allow easier resetting of a user's MFA, as described in this draft policy: <a href="https://infra.apache.org/mfa-reset.html" target="_blank">infra.apache.org/mfa-reset.html</a>.

There was active, supportive discussion of the way this new system will answer a number of needs in the ASF project community.

The minutes of the meeting are at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2025-11-05+1700+UTC" target="_blank">Infra Roundtable 2025-11-05 1700 UTC</a>.

The next Roundtable will be **Wednesday, December 3, 1800 UTC**. (Note the change in UTC). Related to the service difficulties we have been dealing with, the topic is **DDOS: behind the scenes**.


## Automated requests

Infra constantly gets automated requests from people to install Integrations into our GiHhub organization, like "$committer_name requests to install Netflify" or "$othercommitter requests to install ChatGPT..."

Infra will always DENY such automated requests.

If anyone wants to have a third-party app installed into GitHub, they must submit an INFRA Jira ticket explaining the need and the tool requested.


## Email compliance with DMARC/DKIM

Infra has improved standards compliance of emails the ASF mailing list system sends, resulting in more reliable email delivery and a reduction in undelivered list mail, especially for Gmail and Outlook/Hotmail users. Improvements put in place November 20, 2025 seem to have vastly reduced the amount of undeliverable mail sent from ASF accounts.

Details on the improvements are on this wiki page: <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/DMARC+and+DKIM+for+ASF+mail" target="_blank">DMARC and DKIM for ASF mail</a>.

These changes require no action by anyone using the ASF email system.

**More next month!**
