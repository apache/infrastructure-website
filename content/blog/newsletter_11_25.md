**Welcome to *Inside Infra* for November, 2025**

## Roundtable

The October Roundtable featured Drew Foulks presenting on "Infra 101", a presentation he also gave at Community Over Code.

The general discussion included questions and speculation about using AI to simplify build processes, and in other project tasks.

The full summary, including many helpful comments and suggestions, is at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2025-10-01+1700+UTC" target="_blank">Infra Roundtable 2025-10-01 1700 UTC</a>

## Projects to test Wiki and Jira migration
Infra is looking for projects to help evaluate test migrations of their projects' documents and tickets to a test instance of Jira / Confluence on the Atlassian Cloud.

Infra will perform the (test) migration of your Jira project and/or Confluence space(s), so there is nothing for you to do except some testing, like:-

  - Log in to the Cloud test instance (url to be provided to test projects) using either your ASF ID or your non-ASF username, if you use one of those.
  - Browse around your test Jira project / Confluence wiki and ensure all is well.
  - Play around with it: create some Jira tickets, delete some, go through your usual workflow, etc.
  - Provide Feedback!. After a few days playing, or in case of problems., reach out to the Infra  team via an INFRA ticket that we will open for your project's feedback on the test migration process.
  - Participate in discussions on the Slack channel we will set up for early testers.

This is opt in, and is Phase 2 of our planned migration to Atlassian Cloud - Initial user testing. This Phase should last until early November.

Please contact `gmcdonald@apache.org`, or via Infra's Slack channel, #asfinfra, if your project would like to participate - please provide a link to the discussion supporting this decision.
